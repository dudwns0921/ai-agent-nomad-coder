And yet, \"AI digital health solutions hold the potential to enhance efficiency, reduce costs and improve health outcomes globally,\" says the white paper. Here are seven examples of AI technologies already making a difference in the medical field.AI and healthcare2018201920202021202220232024Year010864212Billions $A Flourish chart]( AI can interpret brain scansA new AI software is \" \" as professionals at examining the brain scans of stroke patients. Two UK universities trained the software on a dataset of 800 brain scans of stroke patients and then trialled it on 2,000 patients.The results were impressive. Alongside the AI model\\\\\\'s accuracy, the software was also able to identify the timescale within which the stroke happened - crucial information for professionals.As Dr Paul Bentley, consultant neurologist, told the _Health Tech Newspaper_: “For the majority of strokes caused by a blood clot, if a patient is within 4.5 hours of the stroke happening, he or she is eligible for both medical and surgical treatments. Up to 6 hours, the patient is also eligible for surgical treatment, but after this time point, deciding whether these treatments might be beneficial becomes tricky, as more cases become irreversible. So it’s essential for doctors to know both the initial onset time, as well as whether a stroke could be reversed.”## AI can spot more bone fractures than humans canSurprisingly, urgent care doctors miss broken bones in up to 10% of cases. What’s more, X-ray technicians are both in short supply and overloaded.So using  could potentially avoid both unnecessary X-rays and missed fractures. The UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says the technology is safe, reliable and could reduce the need for follow-up appointments.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesBut there are concerns around the fast rollout of AI in healthcare.\"It is important that people using these tools are properly trained in doing so, meaning they  from technological limitations ... such as the possibility for wrong information being given,\" Dr Caroline Green of the Institute for Ethics in AI at the University of Oxford told the BBC.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum creating guardrails for Artificial Intelligence?Show moreIn response to the uncertainties surrounding generative AI and the need for robust AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes for all, the Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) has launched the .The Alliance unites industry leaders, governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations to champion responsible global design and release of transparent and inclusive AI systems.This includes the workstreams part of the , in collaboration with the Centre for Energy and Materials, the Centre for Advanced Manufacturing and Supply Chains, the Centre for Cybersecurity, the Centre for Nature and Climate, and the Global Industries team.## Assessing ambulance needs with AIIn the UK, around  are taken by ambulance to hospital each month. It’s down to paramedics to decide who does or doesn’t need to go, and always with an awareness of how few beds are available.A study in Yorkshire in the north of England found that in 80% of cases . The AI model was trained on factors such as a patient’s mobility, pulse and blood oxygen levels and chest pain – it also proved to respond without bias. NICE did caution, however, that before being put into more widespread use, more training was needed.## Detecting early signs of more than 1,000 diseasesA new AI machine learning model can  before the patient is even aware of any symptoms, according to its maker AstraZeneca.Using medical data from 500,000 people who are part of a UK health data repository, the machine could “predict with high confidence a disease diagnosis many years later”.Slavé Petrovski, who led the research, told Sky News: \"For many of these diseases, by the time they manifest clinically and the individual goes to the doctor because of an ailment or visible observation, that is far down the line from when the disease process began.“We can pick up signatures in an individual that are highly predictive of developing , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney disease and many others,\" he said.Another UK study has found that an AI tool can successfully detect . Trained on the MRI scans of over 1,100 adults and children globally, the AI tool was able to spot lesions more quickly than a doctor, but also discover tiny or obscured ones that had evaded the human eye.\" ,\" lead researcher Dr Konrad Wagstyl told the BBC. \"AI can find about two-thirds that doctors miss - but a third are still really difficult to find.\" Combining AI\\\\\\'s findings with human oversight and expertise has the potential to speed up both diagnosis and cure, the researchers say.0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 90%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabledShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?Play/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume↑Decrease Volume↓Seek Forward→Seek Backward←Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemDecrease Caption Size-Increase Caption Size+ or =Seek %0-9Live00:0000:0000:00## Clinical chatbots to guide healthcare decisionsDoctors must make informed, swift medical decisions: AI could potentially speed these up, but it could also provide unreliable or biased information.A US study found that standard large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude or Gemini were unable to provide clinicians with sufficiently relevant or evidence-based answers to their medical questions. But ChatRWD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system – which essentially combines LLMs with retrieval systems to improve output – produced useful answers to  (compared with 2%-10% for the LLMs).Digital interfaces are increasingly being rolled out to help triage patients, too. In an , part of the World Economic Forum’s , a case study on digital patient platform Huma, revealed it could reduce readmission rates by 30%, time spent reviewing patients by up to 40% and “alleviated the workload of healthcare providers”.The report anticipates a future in which technologies like these could “dramatically transform the patient experience. People who are generally healthy can use self-monitoring devices to optimize their mental and physical health, while those with health issues will have access to a wide range of digital solutions”.## AI and traditional medicinePracticed in 170 countries and used by billions of people, traditional medicine has maintained its relevance in the modern world in part because of its emphasis on a holistic approach to healthcare. And while . A new brief from the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, \\\\\\'Mapping the application of artificial intelligence in traditional medicine\\\\\\', shows how  (TCIM) while protecting cultural heritage.India is the first country to launch a , utilizing AI tools to catalogue and analyze indigenous medical texts. The country is also exploring how AI and Ayurgenomics - a field which combines the ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda with modern genomics - can intersect, to see what herbal formulations could help tackle modern diseases.Similarly, , while in South Korea, AI is being used to analyze traditional medicine compounds to treat blood disorders.The global TCIM market is expected to reach nearly $600 billion in 2025 - and AI looks set to accelerate that market further and faster. The new brief stresses the importance of safeguarding  in the process.“AI must not become a new frontier for exploitation,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Systems. “We must ensure that Indigenous Peoples and local communities are not only protected but are active partners in shaping the future of AI in traditional medicine.”##### Have you read?- ##### - ##### - ##### ## AI for healthcare adminAdministrative tasks are both inevitable and time-consuming in the medical field. Using AI co-pilots could free up clinicians to focus more of their time on patients.Microsoft has recently announced its , an AI healthcare tool that can listen to, and create notes on, clinical consultations. And  already has a suite of AI models specifically tailored to alleviate some of the administrative burdens in healthcare. In Germany, an AI platform called  has cut testing and diagnosis times from weeks to hours and its founders are determined to show that the technology \"can be an ally, not an obstacle\". Co-founder Dr Sebastian Casu told EU-Startups: \"No one joins the healthcare sector to spend hours on admin\".Of course, having an AI tool listening in and taking notes on your doctor\\\\\\'s appointment will not appeal to everyone. A recent study in the UK found that just  (although over two-thirds are comfortable with the technology being used to free up professionals\\\\\\' time). Then there is the question of accuracy. A report last year found that OpenAI\\\\\\'s Whisper, used by many hospitals to summarize patient meetings, was .This is why regulation of AI tools is so vital. In the UK, AI-powered medical devices are strictly regulated by the .). In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last year  and concluded that, while the FDA will “continue to play a central role in ensuring safe, effective, and trustworthy AI tools” it was also essential that “all involved entities … attend to AI with the rigour this transformative technology merits”.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookies##### Don\\\\\\'t miss any update on this topicCreate a free account and access your personalized content collection with our latest publications and analyses.License and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.##### Share:!## Forum StoriesnewsletterBringing you weekly curated insights and analysis on the global issues that matter.### More onHealth and Healthcare Systems      Camila Pintarelli and Thomas OxleyOctober 9, 2025Bushra AlBlooshi, Hoda Al Khzaimi and Heba AhmadOctober 8, 2025Hoda Al Khzaimi, Bushra AlBlooshi and Heba AhmadOctober 7, 2025Joan-Paula Bor and Kathleen SchmelerOctober 6, 2025Naoko TochibayashiOctober 3, 2025Oct 2, 2025EN   Remove menu\\'}, {\\'title\\': \\'Advancements in Artificial Intelligence for Medical Computer-Aided ...\\', \\'url\\': \\'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11202700/\\', \\'markdown\\': \"![]( websites use .gov**A**.gov** website belongs to an officialgovernment organization in the United States.![]( .gov websites use HTTPS**A **lock** (LockLocked padlock icon) or ** means you\\'ve safelyconnected to the .gov website.

LimitationsAlthough the articles published in this Special Issue present valuable contributions to the field of medical diagnostics leveraging AI and machine learning (ML) techniques, some limitations can be identified across these articles:- (1)Many of these studies have specific focuses or use case scenarios, potentially limiting the generalizability of their findings to broader contexts or populations;- (2)Some articles may have methodological limitations, such as biases in data collection, imbalanced datasets, or reliance on specific classifiers, which could affect the reliability and applicability of their results;- (3)While many studies report impressive results in performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, the evaluation criteria and datasets used may not fully reflect real-world clinical scenarios, leading to potential overestimations of performance;- (4)The interpretation of results may vary across the studies, being potentially influenced by the researchers’ perspectives or biases, which could impact the conclusions drawn from the data.## 4. Future DirectionsMedical image diagnosis powered by artificial intelligence (AI) represents the cutting edge of improvements in healthcare. We should continually strive to enhance the health and wellbeing of our community by providing smart solutions that benefit both patients and physicians. AI technology has significantly advanced medical image diagnosis, improving accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility in healthcare scenarios. AI algorithms can analyze X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, and patient records, such as those of patients with coronary stenosis or Parkinson’s disease, to detect abnormalities such as tumors, fractures, and infections. For example, AI can identify early-stage cancers that might be missed by the human eye. AI can interpret echocardiograms (ECGs) and cardiac MRI scans to detect heart conditions like arrhythmias, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. In light of this, this Special Issue highlights and disseminates the latest breakthroughs in AI-driven diagnostic technologies, with the aim of showcasing innovative research, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and exploring the transformative impact of AI on medical imaging and diagnosis. By bringing together contributions from leading experts, we hope to advance this field of research, improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, and ultimately enhance patient care and health outcomes.The recent rise of large language models (LLMs) like Gemini and medGemini , ] or ChatGPT and BiomedGPT ] presents a transformative opportunity for the healthcare industry, particularly in the realm of diagnosis. These powerful tools can significantly enhance existing diagnostic systems by providing more insightful explanations, ultimately leading to more accurate and efficient patient care. One key contribution of LLMs lies in their ability to generate detailed textual reports. By analyzing vast amounts of medical data, including patient history, test results, and relevant research, LLMs can produce comprehensive reports that not only outline a diagnosis but also explain the reasoning behind it. This detailed explanation assists healthcare professionals by offering a transparent and step-by-step breakdown of how the LLM arrived at its conclusions, fostering trust in the system and allowing doctors to leverage the LLM’s insights while incorporating their own medical expertise. While LLMs cannot directly generate heat maps (i.e., saliency maps) for medical images, they can play a significant role in the process. When integrated with computer vision models, LLMs are able to analyze medical images (X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, etc.), and they can be trained to detect and extract relevant features, anomalies, and patterns from these images. Through this, LLMs have the ability to generate textual descriptions of these highlighted areas that explain why they are important for a certain diagnosis. This provides a form of visual explanation alongside the LLM’s textual report. The combined power of detailed textual explanations and visual heat maps can empower healthcare professionals in several ways:- (1)It improves diagnostic accuracy by offering a comprehensive understanding of the LLM’s reasoning;- (2)It facilitates communication with patients by providing clear and accessible explanations of the diagnostic process , ];- (3)It fosters collaboration between humans and machines, allowing medical professionals to leverage the strengths of LLMs while retaining their own irreplaceable role in healthcare decision making ].However, it is crucial to acknowledge that LLMs are still under development, and their integration into healthcare systems requires careful consideration. Ensuring data privacy and security is paramount, and ongoing human oversight remains essential. In conclusion, LLM-based tools like Gemini and GPTs (Generative Pre-Trained Transformers) hold immense potential to revolutionize healthcare diagnostics. As mentioned above, the detailed textual explanations and visual heat maps provided by these tools can empower healthcare professionals by allowing them gain a deeper understanding of the diagnostic process, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency in patient care. As LLM technology continues to evolve, the future of healthcare diagnosis promises to be one of increased transparency, collaboration, and, ultimately, improved patient outcomes. The development of robust medical XAI models is often hindered by the limited availability of labeled datasets, particularly for rare diseases or specific imaging modalities. Generative AI techniques ] offer promising solutions to address this challenge, enabling the creation of synthetic medical data across various modalities—text, images, signals, etc. LLMs like GPT-3 excel at generating synthetic patient records that closely mimic the structure, terminology, and statistical distributions of real clinical notes. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have revolutionized medical image synthesis, producing realistic X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans that can incorporate specific anatomical variations or pathologies. This not only increases the size of datasets but allows researchers to simulate diverse disease presentations. Additionally, GANs can augment datasets by introducing realistic variations to existing images or even by translating images between modalities (e.g., generating a potential CT scan from an MRI scan), reducing the reliance on acquiring data in multiple ways. Generative models are able to synthesize physiological signals like ECGs, EEGs, and others, replicating real-world patterns and anomalies. This can be leveraged to expand training data for diagnostic models and facilitate the development of monitoring devices. Furthermore, generative AI can create hybrid signals with controlled variations, simulating complex or unusual health conditions to diversify training data.Finally, we can potentially leverage contrastive learning ] to address the challenge of data-labeling exhaustion in the development of LLM-based tools similar to medGemini or BiomedGPT. Contrastive learning is a technique within self-supervised learning where a machine learning model learns by creating its own supervisory signals from unlabeled data. The primary goal of this is to train a model to recognize similarities and differences between data samples: the model learns an embedding space (a kind of representational map) where similar items are clustered together and dissimilar items are far apart. Meanwhile, deep active learning could prove to be capable of supporting and automating the process of labeling medical data.## 5. ConclusionsIn conclusion, this Special Issue underscores the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in medical diagnostics, as evidenced by the collection of cutting-edge research it presents. While these advancements offer unprecedented accuracy and efficiency in disease detection and treatment planning across various medical fields, including radiology, pathology, genomics, and personalized medicine, several limitations persist. These limitations include the potential lack of generalizability, methodological constraints, and the need for the careful interpretation of results. Looking ahead, the integration of large language models (LLMs) like Gemini and medGemini holds promise for further revolutionizing healthcare diagnosis through empowering healthcare professionals with detailed textual explanations and visual heat maps to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis. Despite these advancements, however, ongoing considerations for data privacy, security, and human oversight are essential. Ultimately, the future of healthcare diagnosis promises increased transparency, collaboration, and improved patient outcomes as AI technology continues to evolve and move forward to address current challenges.## AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) for providing support by means of a wide range of research grants from the Korean government (MSIT) (No. RS-2022-00166402 and RS-2023-00256517) for improving AI-based medical diagnostics.

And yet, \"AI digital health solutions hold the potential to enhance efficiency, reduce costs and improve health outcomes globally,\" says the white paper. Here are seven examples of AI technologies already making a difference in the medical field.AI and healthcare2018201920202021202220232024Year010864212Billions $A Flourish chart]( AI can interpret brain scansA new AI software is \" \" as professionals at examining the brain scans of stroke patients. Two UK universities trained the software on a dataset of 800 brain scans of stroke patients and then trialled it on 2,000 patients.The results were impressive. Alongside the AI model\\\\\\'s accuracy, the software was also able to identify the timescale within which the stroke happened - crucial information for professionals.As Dr Paul Bentley, consultant neurologist, told the _Health Tech Newspaper_: “For the majority of strokes caused by a blood clot, if a patient is within 4.5 hours of the stroke happening, he or she is eligible for both medical and surgical treatments. Up to 6 hours, the patient is also eligible for surgical treatment, but after this time point, deciding whether these treatments might be beneficial becomes tricky, as more cases become irreversible. So it’s essential for doctors to know both the initial onset time, as well as whether a stroke could be reversed.”## AI can spot more bone fractures than humans canSurprisingly, urgent care doctors miss broken bones in up to 10% of cases. What’s more, X-ray technicians are both in short supply and overloaded.So using  could potentially avoid both unnecessary X-rays and missed fractures. The UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says the technology is safe, reliable and could reduce the need for follow-up appointments.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesBut there are concerns around the fast rollout of AI in healthcare.\"It is important that people using these tools are properly trained in doing so, meaning they  from technological limitations ... such as the possibility for wrong information being given,\" Dr Caroline Green of the Institute for Ethics in AI at the University of Oxford told the BBC.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum creating guardrails for Artificial Intelligence?Show moreIn response to the uncertainties surrounding generative AI and the need for robust AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes for all, the Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) has launched the .The Alliance unites industry leaders, governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations to champion responsible global design and release of transparent and inclusive AI systems.This includes the workstreams part of the , in collaboration with the Centre for Energy and Materials, the Centre for Advanced Manufacturing and Supply Chains, the Centre for Cybersecurity, the Centre for Nature and Climate, and the Global Industries team.## Assessing ambulance needs with AIIn the UK, around  are taken by ambulance to hospital each month. It’s down to paramedics to decide who does or doesn’t need to go, and always with an awareness of how few beds are available.A study in Yorkshire in the north of England found that in 80% of cases . The AI model was trained on factors such as a patient’s mobility, pulse and blood oxygen levels and chest pain – it also proved to respond without bias. NICE did caution, however, that before being put into more widespread use, more training was needed.## Detecting early signs of more than 1,000 diseasesA new AI machine learning model can  before the patient is even aware of any symptoms, according to its maker AstraZeneca.Using medical data from 500,000 people who are part of a UK health data repository, the machine could “predict with high confidence a disease diagnosis many years later”.Slavé Petrovski, who led the research, told Sky News: \"For many of these diseases, by the time they manifest clinically and the individual goes to the doctor because of an ailment or visible observation, that is far down the line from when the disease process began.“We can pick up signatures in an individual that are highly predictive of developing , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney disease and many others,\" he said.Another UK study has found that an AI tool can successfully detect .

But ChatRWD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system – which essentially combines LLMs with retrieval systems to improve output – produced useful answers to  (compared with 2%-10% for the LLMs).Digital interfaces are increasingly being rolled out to help triage patients, too. In an , part of the World Economic Forum’s , a case study on digital patient platform Huma, revealed it could reduce readmission rates by 30%, time spent reviewing patients by up to 40% and “alleviated the workload of healthcare providers”.The report anticipates a future in which technologies like these could “dramatically transform the patient experience. People who are generally healthy can use self-monitoring devices to optimize their mental and physical health, while those with health issues will have access to a wide range of digital solutions”.## AI and traditional medicinePracticed in 170 countries and used by billions of people, traditional medicine has maintained its relevance in the modern world in part because of its emphasis on a holistic approach to healthcare. And while . A new brief from the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, \\\\\\'Mapping the application of artificial intelligence in traditional medicine\\\\\\', shows how  (TCIM) while protecting cultural heritage.India is the first country to launch a , utilizing AI tools to catalogue and analyze indigenous medical texts. The country is also exploring how AI and Ayurgenomics - a field which combines the ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda with modern genomics - can intersect, to see what herbal formulations could help tackle modern diseases.Similarly, , while in South Korea, AI is being used to analyze traditional medicine compounds to treat blood disorders.The global TCIM market is expected to reach nearly $600 billion in 2025 - and AI looks set to accelerate that market further and faster. The new brief stresses the importance of safeguarding  in the process.“AI must not become a new frontier for exploitation,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Systems. “We must ensure that Indigenous Peoples and local communities are not only protected but are active partners in shaping the future of AI in traditional medicine.”##### Have you read?- ##### - ##### - ##### ## AI for healthcare adminAdministrative tasks are both inevitable and time-consuming in the medical field. Using AI co-pilots could free up clinicians to focus more of their time on patients.Microsoft has recently announced its , an AI healthcare tool that can listen to, and create notes on, clinical consultations. And  already has a suite of AI models specifically tailored to alleviate some of the administrative burdens in healthcare. In Germany, an AI platform called  has cut testing and diagnosis times from weeks to hours and its founders are determined to show that the technology \"can be an ally, not an obstacle\". Co-founder Dr Sebastian Casu told EU-Startups: \"No one joins the healthcare sector to spend hours on admin\".Of course, having an AI tool listening in and taking notes on your doctor\\\\\\'s appointment will not appeal to everyone. A recent study in the UK found that just  (although over two-thirds are comfortable with the technology being used to free up professionals\\\\\\' time). Then there is the question of accuracy. A report last year found that OpenAI\\\\\\'s Whisper, used by many hospitals to summarize patient meetings, was .This is why regulation of AI tools is so vital. In the UK, AI-powered medical devices are strictly regulated by the .). In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last year  and concluded that, while the FDA will “continue to play a central role in ensuring safe, effective, and trustworthy AI tools” it was also essential that “all involved entities … attend to AI with the rigour this transformative technology merits”.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookies##### Don\\\\\\'t miss any update on this topicCreate a free account and access your personalized content collection with our latest publications and analyses.License and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.##### Share:!## Forum StoriesnewsletterBringing you weekly curated insights and analysis on the global issues that matter.### More onHealth and Healthcare Systems      Camila Pintarelli and Thomas OxleyOctober 9, 2025Bushra AlBlooshi, Hoda Al Khzaimi and Heba AhmadOctober 8, 2025Hoda Al Khzaimi, Bushra AlBlooshi and Heba AhmadOctober 7, 2025Joan-Paula Bor and Kathleen SchmelerOctober 6, 2025Naoko TochibayashiOctober 3, 2025Oct 2, 2025EN   Remove menu\\'}, {\\'title\\': \\'Improving Patient Care and Safety With AI - Healthcare Executive\\', \\'url\\': \\'https://www.healthcareexecutive.org/archives/march-april-2024/improving-patient-care--and-safety-with-ai\\', \\'markdown\\': \\'By Topic: TechnologyInformation ManagementSafety QualityBy Collection: Safety![]( intelligence has demonstrated that it can improve patient care and safety by helping clinicians analyze imaging and pathology reports.\\\\xa0Many applications, though, are still in the early stages of development and adoption, especially in the automation of administrative tasks.“For quality care, I believe AI allows us to augment clinical decision-making,” says Sachin Shah, MD, an associate professor of medicine and pediatrics and chief medical information officer at UChicago Medicine in Chicago. He notes there is a sizable predictive analytics and machine learning space that can significantly leverage the large amount of data available. As a result, “we can better identify patterns, predict health issues and customize treatment plans,” Shah says.Achieving that level of precision and personalization at the patient level will help improve outcomes and streamline many care-delivery processes, according to Shah.Patient safety is also enhanced by AI’s capacity to analyze vast volumes of data in real time. “This can lead to early detection of clinical deterioration, intervention ahead of potential adverse drug reactions and an overall reduction of medical errors,” Shah says. “Clinicians are alerted sooner that something may be trending in the wrong direction, well before it may become clinically evident.”### AI’s PotentialRichard Greenhill, DHA, CPHQ, FACHE, director of the undergraduate healthcare management program in the School of Health Professions at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, says high-quality healthcare depends on reliable and accurate processes in the delivery of patient care “to ensure that safety is prioritized for sustainable outcomes. Process variation is the enemy of quality, so the tools of AI are exciting because they can undertake some of the more routine and repeatable processes that are susceptible to the impact of human factors.”The TTUHSC Institute of Telehealth and Digital Innovation was established in September 2023 to create a digital health ecosystem, where technologies such as AI transform care delivery in West Texas. “AI has the potential to unleash new ways of approaching performance improvement and patient safety as we begin to tap into the universe of data that encompasses health—both inside and outside of the delivery system,” says Greenhill.Systems thinking is also an important component of quality care. “Systems thinking in care delivery helps us focus on interrelationships in processes to solve complex problems in our quality improvement strategy,” Greenhill explains. “This is why we should not ever first blame people when a medical mistake or undesired event occurs. A system produces the results for which it was designed. Thus, a person or a tool, such as AI in our delivery system, can never itself be the focus when an error occurs.”Healthcare facilities must look deeply at the design\\\\xa0of how these resources were planned for and supported in their activities, according to Greenhill. AI allows\\\\xa0“us to look across interprofessional processes and aggregate datasets to discover insights that we may not\\\\xa0have assumed.” Examples include early detection via analysis of diagnostic studies, such as radiology and clinical lab, and more quickly identifying high-risk patients based on treatment and disease progression. “AI can assist quality professionals, clinicians and\\\\xa0leaders to make sense of the complexities in our systems in managing risks associated with handoffs,\\\\xa0care coordination and treatment interventions,” Greenhill says.AI can enhance patient care in everything from ophthalmology to cardiology and pathology/oncology to psychiatry, according to Thomas Fuchs, DrSc, dean of the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine in New York City. “AI should help physicians to be faster and more effective, do new things they currently cannot do and reduce burnout,” he says.Even before the AI department was established in the fall of 2021, Mount Sinai was testing AI systems in the ICU to alert nurses to patient risk of malnutrition, deterioration or fall, along with reducing false alarms and staff overhead. The AI system takes information from the EHR and various devices in the ICU.Cancer detection. AI has also benefited pathology at Mount Sinai by detecting cancer and grading cancer earlier than before. The institution has developed an AI foundation model based on 3 billion images from 400,000 digital microscopy slides of cancer biopsies and resections. “The model can detect biomarkers to predict what cancer treatment will work for a specific patient,” Fuchs says.Diagnostic imaging assisted by AI holds promise, as well. A retrospective study published online in European Radiology in March 2023 concluded that among more than 1,200 breast cancer cases in Norway, an AI system scored 93% of the screen-detected cancers and 40% of the interval cancers with an AI score of 10 (on a scale of 1 to 10, based on the risk of malignancy). Furthermore, the AI system scored all screen-detected cancers and nearly 50% of interval cancers in women with the highest breast density with an AI score of 10. This resulted in a sensitivity of 80.9% for women with the highest breast density for the AI system, compared to 62.8% for independent double reading by radiologists.Roughly 40% of the screen-detected cancers achieved an AI score of 10 on the prior mammograms, indicating a potential for earlier detection by using AI in screen-reading.Physicians at the Breast Center at Mount Sinai Medical Center believe that the use of AI for detecting new abnormalities in mammograms and MRI scans is promising. They also predict that AI will help radiologists interpret mammograms while reducing the number of false positive interpretations, thus avoiding unnecessary biopsies. However, further research is needed to ensure the technology’s reliability and the anticipated benefits.Informatics. Excitement about the potential for AI led the University of Kentucky to form a multidisciplinary collaborative of physicians, data scientists, biomedical engineers and others to form the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Alliance. After two years of success in starting projects around radiology, pharmacy and cancer, the alliance merged in 2022 with an innovations program to form the Center for Applied AI within biomedical informatics for even broader AI applications across healthcare and the university. Most AI healthcare initiatives at the university hospital stem from a desire to improve quality of care and reporting, such as better implementing the recommendation from the Society of Thoracic Surgery that a patient take a beta-blocker within 24 hours of surgery. Using tools already developed or in development in one discipline allows center members to more quickly apply solutions to other projects.A chatbot is being developed at the college that will connect with patients preparing to undergo cardiac surgery. The chatbot would help guide patients on when to take their medicine and help answer questions they may have about the surgery.Over the past year, there has been a rapid increase in the optimization of administrative tasks completed via AI, including documentation, prior authorizations and revenue cycling. “We are also able to better communicate with our patients and give our patients more self-efficacy,” Shah of UChicago Medicine says. “Conversational AI is very well suited to replace many of the burdensome nonclinical tasks that do not require clinical judgement.AI offers an opportunity to enhance quality care by augmenting clinical decision-making, according to Shah. “Through predictive analytics and machine learning, we can leverage vast amounts of data to identify patterns, predict potential health issues and customize treatment plans for individual patients. This personalization can significantly improve outcomes and streamline care delivery processes.”Similarly, AI’s role in patient safety “lies in its ability to analyze data in real time, allowing for early detection of potential risks such as adverse drug interactions or deteriorating patient condition,” Shah says. AI-powered systems can also assist in proactive interventions, thus reducing medical errors and ensuring timely and accurate care, all of which ultimately safeguard patient well-being.UChicago Medicine is scheduled to begin a pilot study this spring comprising 250 of its physicians to leverage generative AI to streamline and take over much of the clinical documentation.Some EHR providers include AI algorithms in their products, according to Greenhill. “These tools show promise to augment and enhance work for clinicians,” he says. “However, as these tools become more widely used, we need to maintain vigilance about the risk that they pose to patients and processes due to model and data bias.”AI chatbots—automated software applications—can perform many mundane tasks and reduce the burden on staff, physicians and nurses so they can pursue “the meaningful work they signed up to do, such as physicians spending more time with patients,” Greenhill says.“If a human does the same task 10 times every hour,\\\\xa0he or she is more likely to make a mistake due to a\\\\xa0host of human factors,” Greenhill says. By contrast,\\\\xa0AI chatbots can operate nonstop, requiring neither breaks nor rest. “This is a win in the war on process variation,” he says.Surgical care. Danielle Walsh, MD, FAAP, FACS, a professor of surgery and vice chair of Surgery for Quality and Process Improvement at the University\\\\xa0of Kentucky College of Medicine in Lexington, was part of a panel of surgeons who discussed the impact\\\\xa0of AI on surgical practices at the American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress 2023 in October. By allowing AI to take over many of the repetitive and rote administrative tasks that burden physicians, “the physician can perform more cognitive decision-making and focus more on human connections and time spent with patients,” says Walsh.AI will also play a major role in mandatory reporting of quality metrics to governmental and other entities, according to Walsh, freeing up even more staff members to perform more substantial work to truly improve quality of care. A study published online in JAMA Network in June 2023 on resources spent on just measuring and reporting data on 162 unique quality metrics found that an estimated 108,478 person-hours with a personnel cost of $5 million and another $603,000 in vendor fees were required. “Those funds are better spent on interventions than reporting,” Walsh says.AI tools also can communicate with a patient at home to ensure drug adherence, collect feedback on how patients are feeling, and use that feedback to become more connected with the patient in between visits or after discharge from the hospital. “And if you add in digital sensors, we can do tremendous monitoring at home,” Walsh says. “During COVID, people at home were at ICU-level care.”A patient with a blood vessel bypassed in the leg, for example, could wear a sock with a sensor at home to detect if blood flow begins to decrease before the blood vessel blocks off again and before the patient develops a blue, painful foot. “AI combined with sensors will allow us to intervene earlier and prevent more serious complications,” Walsh says.### Looking ForwardAs for AI cost, some healthcare facilities already have 5G network capability, along with modern wiring and systems that are compatible with AI, while others will need to invest in infrastructure improvements. “There will also be tradeoffs,” Walsh says. “Because AI requires a tremendous amount of computing power, you are not going to be able to run every AI algorithm simultaneously. And as the area grows, you will need to prioritize AI systems that meet the needs of a specific institution and the specific patient population being served.”Which areas of AI to pursue differ by organization and their culture, according to Shah, and are determined by staffing and the ability of teams and leadership to adjust. “There is not necessarily a lot of replacement of human expertise coming, but certainly a lot of reallocating human resources to different work that is ideally more top-of-license work, by automating some of the repetitive administrative tasks and algorithmic work,” he says.However, the quality of the output from AI is contingent on the quality of data entered, “so you need to invest a lot into your data infrastructure,” Shah says. “The quality of your data needs to be high.”There are also ethical considerations. “There has to be clear transparency around the decision-making in these models,” Shah says. “The concept of algorithmic bias is really important to understand and to ensure we are minimizing. Humans need to be at the center to carefully scrutinize any potential bias by closely monitoring the inputs, the algorithms and outputs to ensure they are not leading to unintended consequences.”_Bob Kronemyer is a freelance writer based in Elkhart, Ind._### Acceptance and Implementation StrategiesDanielle Walsh, MD, FAAP, FACS, a professor of surgery and vice chair of Surgery for Quality and Process Improvement at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine in Lexington, believes there are two big myths about using AI in healthcare: that physicians don’t want AI and that patients don’t want AI.****\\'}]', name='web_search_tool', call_id='call_VMsXcnyqQcMvApHu6L6AaZb3', is_error=False), FunctionExecutionResult(content='[{\\'title\\': \\'AI in Healthcare Statistics: Market Insights & Growth - Binariks\\', \\'url\\': \\'https://binariks.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-ai-healthcare-market/\\', \\'markdown\\': \\'- ![]( ![]( ![]( AI in Healthcare Statistics: Market Insights & GrowthUpdated Jun 26, 2025 · 9 min readHealthcareData Science and AI/MLAI DevelopmentContent      !Artificial Intelligence has a great demand in the healthcare industry.

However, accuracy significantly decreased by 11.3% when clinicians were shown systematically biased AI model predictions and model explanations did not mitigate the negative effects of such predictions.### MeaningAI model explanations did not help clinicians recognize systematically biased AI models.## Abstract### ImportanceArtificial intelligence (AI) could support clinicians when diagnosing hospitalized patients; however, systematic bias in AI models could worsen clinician diagnostic accuracy. Recent regulatory guidance has called for AI models to include explanations to mitigate errors made by models, but the effectiveness of this strategy has not been established.### ObjectivesTo evaluate the impact of systematically biased AI on clinician diagnostic accuracy and to determine if image-based AI model explanations can mitigate model errors.### Design, Setting, and ParticipantsRandomized clinical vignette survey study administered between April 2022 and January 2023 across 13 US states involving hospitalist physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants.### InterventionsClinicians were shown 9 clinical vignettes of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory failure, including their presenting symptoms, physical examination, laboratory results, and chest radiographs. Clinicians were then asked to determine the likelihood of pneumonia, heart failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as the underlying cause(s) of each patient’s acute respiratory failure. To establish baseline diagnostic accuracy, clinicians were shown 2 vignettes without AI model input. Clinicians were then randomized to see 6 vignettes with AI model input with or without AI model explanations. Among these 6 vignettes, 3 vignettes included standard-model predictions, and 3 vignettes included systematically biased model predictions.### Main Outcomes and MeasuresClinician diagnostic accuracy for pneumonia, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.### ResultsMedian participant age was 34 years (IQR, 31-39) and 241 (57.7%) were female. Four hundred fifty-seven clinicians were randomized and completed at least 1 vignette, with 231 randomized to AI model predictions without explanations, and 226 randomized to AI model predictions with explanations. Clinicians’ baseline diagnostic accuracy was 73.0% (95% CI, 68.3% to 77.8%) for the 3 diagnoses. When shown a standard AI model without explanations, clinician accuracy increased over baseline by 2.9 percentage points (95% CI, 0.5 to 5.2) and by 4.4 percentage points (95% CI, 2.0 to 6.9) when clinicians were also shown AI model explanations. Systematically biased AI model predictions decreased clinician accuracy by 11.3 percentage points (95% CI, 7.2 to 15.5) compared with baseline and providing biased AI model predictions with explanations decreased clinician accuracy by 9.1 percentage points (95% CI, 4.9 to 13.2) compared with baseline, representing a nonsignificant improvement of 2.3 percentage points (95% CI, −2.7 to 7.2) compared with the systematically biased AI model.### Conclusions and RelevanceAlthough standard AI models improve diagnostic accuracy, systematically biased AI models reduced diagnostic accuracy, and commonly used image-based AI model explanations did not mitigate this harmful effect.### Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: * * *This randomized clinical vignette study examines whether providing AI explanations to biased AI models enhances clinician diagnostic accuracy.## IntroductionArtificial intelligence (AI) shows promise in identifying abnormalities in clinical images, such as pneumonia from chest radiographs, diabetic retinopathy from fundus images, or skin cancer from histopathology images., , ,  AI models in clinical care analyze patient data, identify patterns, and make predictions. Integrating AI into clinical decision-making may result in higher accuracy than a clinician without AI. However, systematically biased AI models (ie, models that consistently misdiagnose patient subpopulations) can lead to errors and potential harm., ,  For example, an AI model trained on data in which female patients are consistently underdiagnosed for heart disease may learn this bias and underdiagnose females if deployed. Physician performance can be harmed by following incorrect predictions, a phenomenon known as _overreliance_. Ideally, clinicians would be able to follow AI predictions when correct but ignore incorrect AI predictions. However, the extent to which AI can be safely integrated to support diagnostic decisions is still largely unknown.Recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance highlights the importance of providing clinicians with the ability to independently review the basis for software recommendations, including the information and logic used in a model’s decisions. Although AI developers frequently use AI explanations to debug models during development, providing similar explanations to clinicians, as recommended by the FDA, could potentially enhance interpretability after deployment. Explanations could help clinicians better understand a model’s logic before acting on its recommendation, helping to mitigate errors made by systematically biased models. For example, image-based explanations designed to highlight important regions of an image that were used in an AI model’s decision could help clinicians identify when models are behaving inaccurately.To determine if providing AI explanations could enhance clinician diagnostic accuracy and alleviate the negative impact of systematically biased models, we conducted a randomized clinical vignette web-based survey study. We focused on the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure as a test case for this broader challenge because acute respiratory failure is commonly encountered in practice, often misdiagnosed, and evaluated using commonly encountered data such as chest radiographs that AI tools can analyze. We presented participants with standard and systematically biased AI, randomizing participants to see AI predictions alone or AI predictions with explanations. This design allowed us to test our hypothesis that systematically biased models would harm clinician diagnostic accuracy, but commonly used image-based explanations would help clinicians partially recover their performance.## Methods### ParticipantsWe recruited hospitalist physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants who commonly care for patients with acute respiratory failure to complete the study. The study protocol is available in  and the statistical analysis plan in . We first identified 12 hospitalist leaders as site champions through interaction with the Society of Hospital Medicine research committee and the authors’ personal contacts. Site champions advertised the study via email to their local hospital medicine divisions. Each site champion sent a follow-up reminder email after 2 weeks. Interested participants were directed to the study landing page, which confirmed study eligibility, provided additional study information, study instructions, and obtained informed consent prior to randomization (see the study protocol in  and eFigure 1 in ). Participants were offered a $50 gift card for completing the study.This study was deemed exempt by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. Although the study was not registered initially given its vignette-based design, to ensure it was appropriately reflected in the trial literature, it was registered on ClinicialTrials.gov after its completion with the registration parameters based on the prespecified protocol.### Clinical VignettesWe created 45 clinical vignettes based on patients hospitalized with acute respiratory failure in 2017 at the University of Michigan. Patients were selected to achieve study goals while being representative of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory failure (see eMethods in ). A study team member reviewed each patient’s chart to create a succinct version of the patient’s presenting history, past medical history, current medications, physical examination findings, laboratory findings, and chest radiograph for each vignette (eFigure 2 in ). At least 4 pulmonary physicians independently reviewed each patient’s complete medical record to determine if pneumonia, heart failure, and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was the patient’s underlying diagnosis.Each vignette had 3 reference diagnostic labels pertaining to pneumonia, heart failure, and COPD based on the average of these reviews, and each reference label was binary, indicating whether the disease was present or absent. See eTable 1 in  for patient characteristics for additional details.### Study DesignThe survey was conducted using a Qualtrics survey tool. Participants were assigned 9 of 45 clinical vignettes to review. All participants followed the same vignette order: 2 vignettes without AI predictions, 6 vignettes with AI predictions, and 1 vignette with a clinical consultation by a hypothetical colleague ( ). Upon study initiation, all participants were randomized to AI predictions with or without AI explanations for all 6 AI vignettes, and all participants were also randomized to see 1 of 3 types of systematically biased AI models during 3 of the 6 AI vignettes.#### Figure 1. Randomization and Study Flow Diagram for the 9 Clinical Vignettes.]( in a new tab]( completing informed consent, participants were randomized to artificial intelligence (AI) predictions with or without explanations and all participants were also randomized to 1 of 3 types of systematically biased AI models during a subset of vignettes in the study. The 3 systematically biased AI models included a model predicting pneumonia if aged 80 years or older, a model predicting heart failure if body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 30 or higher, and a model predicting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) if a blur was applied to the radiograph. Participants were first shown 2 vignettes without AI predictions to measure baseline diagnostic accuracy. The next 6 vignettes included AI predictions. If the participant was randomized to see AI explanations, the participant was also shown an AI model explanation with the AI predictions. Three vignettes had standard AI predictions, and 3 had biased AI predictions shown in random order. The final vignette included a clinical consultation, a short narrative provided by a hypothetical trusted colleague who identified the correct diagnosis and their diagnostic rationale.The first 2 vignettes did not include AI predictions and were used to measure baseline diagnostic accuracy. The next 6 vignettes included AI predictions immediately after the patient case. If randomized to see AI explanations, the participant was also shown an image-based AI model explanation alongside the AI predictions. Three vignettes had standard AI predictions and 3 had biased predictions shown in random order. The final vignette included a clinical consultation, a short narrative provided by a hypothetical trusted colleague describing the rationale behind the most likely diagnosis and recommended treatments. By design, the clinical consultation vignette always recommended the correct diagnosis and treatment, serving as a realistic upper bound of participant diagnostic accuracy when provided accurate recommendations.After each vignette, participants were asked to separately assess how likely pneumonia, heart failure, or COPD was contributing to the patient’s respiratory failure on a scale of 0 to 100 (eFigure 3 in ). Responses were collected on a continuous scale to calculate the correlation between AI model scores and participant responses. In calculating accuracy, responses of 50 or higher were considered positive for the diagnosis. Patients could have 1, more than 1, or none of the conditions. After completing the diagnostic assessment, participants were asked whether they would administer any combination of steroids, antibiotics, intravenous (IV) diuretics, or none of these treatments to the patient.### Standard and Systematically Biased AI Model Predictions and ExplanationsWhen participants were shown AI predictions, the model provided a score for each diagnosis on a scale of 0 to 100 estimating how likely the patient’s symptoms were due to pneumonia, heart failure, and COPD ( ). Standard AI predictions were generated using a machine learning model trained using standard approaches on a separate data set. All participants were randomized to see 1 of 3 systematically biased AI models: (1) a model predicting a high likelihood of pneumonia for a patient who was 80 years or older; (2) a model predicting a high likelihood of heart failure if a patient’s body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 30 or higher; and (3) a model predicting a high likelihood of COPD if a blur was applied to the radiograph (eMethods in ). Vignettes with biased models were shown for patients with attributes leading the biased model to predict the diagnosis with high likelihood. For example, a participant randomized to see the model biased for age was shown vignettes of patients 80 years or older with the biased model, and the model displayed a high likelihood prediction for pneumonia and standard predictions for the 2 other diagnoses.#### Figure 2. Examples of Model Predictions and Explanations for Standard and Systematically Biased AI Models for Patients.!Patient 1 is an 81-year-old male with respiratory failure from heart failure. A, The standard AI model correctly diagnosed heart failure as the cause of acute respiratory failure and provided an explanation highlighting areas in the chest radiograph used to make the prediction. B, The systematically biased AI model incorrectly diagnosed pneumonia as the cause of acute respiratory failure due to the patient’s age and provided an explanation highlighting irrelevant features in the chest radiograph. Standard-model predictions for heart failure (the correct diagnosis) are also provided.Patient 2 is an 88-year-old female with respiratory failure from COPD. C, The standard AI model incorrectly diagnosed pneumonia and correctly diagnosed COPD as the cause of respiratory failure and provided reasonable explanations. D, The biased AI model incorrectly diagnosed pneumonia as the cause of respiratory failure due to patient age and provided an explanation highlighting irrelevant features in the chest radiograph. Standard-model predictions for COPD (the correct diagnosis) are also provided.For participants randomized to explanations, explanations were presented when the AI model provided a score of 50 or higher (corresponding to positive diagnosis). Explanations were shown as Grad-CAM heatmaps overlaid on the chest radiograph that highlighted which regions of the image most affecting the model’s prediction ( ). Explanations generated from the standard model highlighted clinically meaningful regions on the chest radiograph (eg, lungs). Explanations associated with the systematically biased models highlighted areas of the radiograph corresponding to age, BMI, or preprocessing (eg, low bone density, soft tissue; ; and see eMethods in  3 for details of how biased model explanations were generated). Because the biased models always made positive predictions, participants randomized to explanations were always shown explanations with biased predictions. In contrast, when shown standard-model predictions, explanations were shown with 17 pneumonia predictions (38%) , 18 heart failure predictions (40%), and 9 COPD predictions (20%).By design, the standard model had an overall accuracy of 75% and the biased models had overall accuracy of 70% (eTable 2 in ), which is on par with physicians and reflects the difficulty of the diagnostic tasks. Therefore, such models would likely meet specifications by regulators for approval. However, among the subset of patients for whom the biased models made biased predictions, the biased models were 33% accurate, whereas the standard model was 67% accurate.### Participant DemographicsAfter completing the vignettes, participant demographic information, including self-reported gender, race, and ethnicity, was collected to assess sample diversity and representativeness. Participants were also asked about AI knowledge (see eMethods for the postsurvey questions in ).### Study OutcomesThe primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy between vignette settings, defined as the number of correct diagnostic assessments over the total number of assessments. Participants made 3 separate assessments in each vignette, 1 for each diagnosis. If the participant’s assessment agreed with the reference label, the diagnostic assessment was correct. Overall accuracy was calculated using assessments for all diagnoses. Accuracy for a specific diagnosis was calculated using assessments relevant to the specific diagnosis.In vignettes with biased model predictions, the biased model provided a prediction for the diagnosis for which it was biased and standard predictions for the 2 other diagnoses. Although participants made 3 diagnostic assessments in those vignettes, only diagnostic assessments corresponding to the biased predictions were included in the accuracy calculation.Secondary outcomes included treatment selection accuracy, correlation between participants’ diagnostic assessment scores and model scores, and confusion matrices across vignette settings.### Statistical AnalysisThe primary preplanned analysis compared diagnostic accuracy between the clinician baseline and each AI model vignette setting. This analysis sought to specifically determine (1) whether standard AI improved clinician accuracy, (2) whether standard AI with explanations improved accuracy, (3) whether biased AI hurt diagnostic accuracy, and (4) whether biased AI with explanations helped clinicians recover from the biased predictions.Completed vignettes were included in the analysis regardless of whether a participant completed all 9 vignettes. Diagnostic accuracy across vignette settings was compared by fitting a cross-classified, generalized, random-effects model, in which individual diagnostic assessments were nested within study participants and patients. The outcome was a binary variable indicating whether the diagnostic assessment was correct and the exposure was the specific vignette setting for which the assessment was performed. Predictive margins and contrasts were calculated to estimate accuracy at each vignette setting, and differences between settings, with 95% CIs were calculated using the delta method.Exploratory subgroup analyses were also conducted by specific diagnosis, clinician profession, and participant’s prior interactions with clinical decision support. A secondary analysis was conducted to understand the effect of correct and incorrect model predictions on treatment selection accuracy.We aimed to recruit 400 participants based on simulation-based power calculations. The simulation ensured adequate power to detect a 20% decrease in accuracy with the systematically biased AI model compared with baseline and 10% improvement with AI explanations (eMethods in  3 and the statistical analysis plan in ). Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 16 (StataCorp). Statistical significance was based on a _P_ value <.05. _P_ values for multiple comparisons were not adjusted in the preplanned analyses.## ResultsOf 1024 participants who viewed the study information page, 572 (56%) initiated the study and were randomized ( ; eFigure 4 in ). Four hundred fifty-seven participants completed at least 1 vignette and were included in the primary analysis, including 226 randomized to AI model and explanations. Four hundred eighteen participants completed all 9 vignettes. Study participants were from 13 US states (eTable 3 in ). Participant demographics did not meaningfully differ across randomization groups (eTable 4 in ). The majority (97.6%) of participants’ general practice area was hospital medicine. The median age was 34 years (IQR, 31-39); 241 participants (57.7%) were female; and 19.1% of participants self-reported as Asian, 1.7% as Black, and 68.1% as White. Of all the participants, 31.6% of had previously interacted with clinical decision support tools and 66.7% were unaware that AI could be systematically biased based on patient demographics.### Table.

Accuracy was 67.5% (95% CI, 61.0%-74.0%) for pneumonia, 70.7% (95% CI, 63.1%-78.3%) for heart failure, and 80.5% (95% CI, 74.8%-86.1%) for COPD ( ; eTable 5 in ). Provided with standard AI predictions, participant diagnostic accuracy for each disease category increased to 75.9% (95% CI, 71.3%-80.5%), an increase of 2.9 percentage points (95% CI, 0.5-5.2; _P_\\\\u2009=\\\\u2009.02; ( ; eTables 5 and 6 in ). Providing standard AI predictions with explanations increased accuracy to 77.5% (95% CI, 73.0%-82.0%), an increase of 4.4 percentage points from baseline (95% CI, 2.0-6.9; _P_\\\\u2009<\\\\u2009.001; ; eTables 5 and 6 in ). Participant diagnostic accuracy was 81.1% (95% CI, 76.9%-85.4%) when shown a clinical consultation with perfect accuracy ( ; eTable 5 in ).#### Figure 3. Baseline Diagnostic Accuracy Without AI Models and Percentage Point Differences in Accuracy Across Clinical Vignette Settings.]( in a new tab]( indicates diagnostic accuracy of heart failure, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) when shown clinical vignettes of patients with acute respiratory failure without AI model input; standard model, diagnostic accuracy when shown clinical vignettes and standard AI model diagnostic predictions about whether the patient has heart failure, pneumonia, and/or COPD; standard model plus explanations, diagnostic accuracy when shown standard AI predictions and an image-based AI explanation of the model’s reasoning for making a prediction within vignettes; systematically biased model, diagnostic accuracy when shown systematically biased AI predictions of low accuracy within vignettes; systematically biased model plus explanations, diagnostic accuracy when shown biased model predictions and explanations within vignettes; and clinical consultation, diagnostic accuracy when provided a short narrative describing the rational for the correct diagnosis within the vignette.Subgroup analysis included diagnostic accuracy specific to heart failure, pneumonia, and COPD; clinician profession, including 142 nurse practitioners or physician assistants, and 274 physicians; prior clinical decision–support interaction, including 132 participants who had prior experience interacting with clinical decision support systems and 286 who did not. Diagnostic accuracy and percentage point differences in accuracy were determined by calculating predictive margins and contrasts across vignette settings after fitting a cross-classified generalized random effects model of diagnostic accuracy.Systematically biased AI predictions without explanations decreased participant diagnostic accuracy to 61.7% (95% CI, 55.3%-68.2%), a decrease of 11.3 percentage points (95% CI, 7.2-15.5; _P_\\\\u2009<\\\\u2009.001) from the baseline score ( ; eTables 5 and 6 in ). This was mostly due to a decrease in participants’ diagnostic specificity (73% [95% CI, 71%-75%] to 53% [95% CI, 49%-58%]; eFigure 5 in ). When shown systematically biased AI with explanations, accuracy was 64.0% (95% CI, 57.6%-70.3%), a decrease of 9.1 percentage points (95% CI, 4.9-13.2; _P_ <.001) from the baseline score, which did not significantly differ from clinician diagnostic accuracy with biased AI without explanations (difference, 2.3 percentage points [95% CI, −2.7 to 7.2]; _P_\\\\u2009=\\\\u2009.37; eTables 5 and 7 in ), with little improvement to participants’ diagnostic specificity (53% [95% CI, 49%-58%] to 56% ). The direction of all effects was similar in all exploratory subgroup analyses ( ).### Secondary OutcomesCorrelations between participant responses and standard-model predictions and predictions with explanations were 0.53 (95% CI, 0.50-0.57) and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.56-0.62) respectively (eTable 8 in ). Correlations between participant responses and biased model predictions and predictions with explanations were 0.41 (95% CI, 0.38-0.45) and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.37-0.45), respectively.Treatment selection accuracy was 70.3% (95% CI, 65.5%-75.2%) without model predictions ( ; eTable 9 in ). When shown correct AI predictions, accuracy increased to 77.0% (95% CI, 72.6%-81.4%), an increase of 6.7 percentage points (95% CI, 4.1-9.3; ; eTables 9 and 10 in ). Accuracy was 80.4% (95% CI, 76.3%-84.5%) when shown correct AI predictions and explanations ( ; eTable 9 in ). When provided incorrect model predictions, participants treatment selection accuracy was 55.1% (95% CI, 48.8%-61.3%), a decrease of 15.3 percentage points (95% CI, 11.4-19.1) ( ; eTables 9 and 10 in ). When shown incorrect model predictions, providing explanations did not significantly increase participant accuracy ( ; eTable 11 in ).#### Figure 4. Baseline Treatment Selection Accuracy Without AI Models and Percentage Point Differences in Accuracy Across Clinical Vignette Settings.]( in a new tab]( treatment selection accuracy indicates accurate administration of antibiotics, diuretics, and/or steroids after reviewing vignettes of patients with acute respiratory failure without AI model input; correct model, treatment accuracy when shown vignette with correct AI model diagnostic predictions of heart failure, pneumonia, and/or COPD; correct model plus explanations, treatment accuracy when shown a vignette with correct AI model diagnostic predictions and an image-based AI explanation of the model’s reason for making a prediction; incorrect model, treatment accuracy when shown a vignette with incorrect AI model diagnostic predictions; and incorrect model plus explanation, treatment accuracy when shown incorrect AI model diagnostic predictions and explanations.Subgroup analysis included treatment selection accuracy specific to antibiotics, intravenous diuretics, and steroids. Treatment selection accuracy and percentage point differences in accuracy were determined by calculating predictive margins and contrasts across vignette settings after fitting a cross-classified generalized random-effects model of treatment selection accuracy across settings.## DiscussionThis study examined how AI predictions and popular image-based AI model explanations could potentially help or worsen clinicians’ diagnostic and treatment decisions in patients with acute respiratory failure. The results showed that clinicians’ diagnostic accuracy improved when shown predictions from a standard AI model, but decreased when shown systematically biased AI predictions. Providing explanations did little to remedy the harmful effects of biased models on clinician accuracy. AI models trained on clinical data are prone to making biased predictions based on clinically irrelevant findings., ,  Left unchecked, models could exacerbate biases widespread in health care, and errors in clinical judgment influenced by AI could have severe consequences such as patient harm.Although the standard and systematically biased models shown in the vignettes had imperfect accuracy, their performance reflected what might be expected in real-world settings for models approved by regulators for difficult tasks like the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure. Even clinicians had only 81.1% diagnostic accuracy when provided perfectly accurate recommendations in the clinical consultation vignettes, which might reflect participant’s difficulty in recognizing perfectly accurate recommendations in these settings. This could also suggest that as AI models improve, there may be an upper bound on collaborative performance between AI models and clinicians for difficult diagnostic tasks.To measure whether explanations could mitigate errors made by systematically biased AI models, explanations were presented in a way that were considered to be obvious—the model relied completely on features unrelated to the clinical condition. Prior work outside of health care has shown that explanations can reduce overreliance on AI models when the task is cognitively difficult, but verifying the explanation is less costly in comparison. Although some have suggested that state-of-the-art explanations should lead to better user-AI interactions, participants in this study were unable to recognize overtly biased models with such explanations. This behavior aligns with work showing that users may still be deceived by incompetent AI models if they fail to understand the models’ simple explanations.Clinicians’ inability to leverage explanations when presented with systematically biased AI models may be due to several reasons. First, clinicians might have limited AI literacy. For example, 66.7% of participants were unaware that AI models could be systematically biased. Informing clinicians of the strengths and weaknesses of AI could make them more adept at leveraging model explanations. Second, clinicians were only shown a small number of the vignettes with explanations, and might need more training with image-based explanations. Third, common image-based AI model explanations, such as those tested in this study, are only approximations of model behavior., ,  They require users to form a mental model of what the explanation is communicating because the AI model cannot communicate in plain language what it is focusing on. It is possible that explanations may be more helpful when presented in a different way (eg, with text descriptions).### Study ImplicationsClinicians’ limited ability to recognize when AI models are systematically biased has important implications for medical AI regulatory policies. The FDA recently released guidance highlighting the importance of providing clinicians with the ability to independently verify clinical support software recommendations., ,  Explanations were also emphasized in the White House blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. Despite providing clinicians with tools with the ability to explain and that could aid them in identifying AI model mistakes, this study demonstrates that the ability to check an AI model’s reasoning using current image-based explanation approaches could fail to provide meaningful safeguards against systematically biased models.There are several potential paths forward to safely integrate AI in health care. First, additional training in limitations of AI systems could be incorporated into medical training, better equipping clinicians to identify biased models. Second, researchers developing explanation tools should involve clinicians to better understand their specific needs. Third, standardizing clinician-facing AI model information in simple language and empirically testing such standards may help clinicians understand appropriate model use and limitations. Finally, this study highlights the critical need for careful model validation, including appropriate subgroup testing, to identify and address biased behavior prior to deployment.### LimitationsThe current study has several limitations. First, it was conducted using a web-based survey interface, which is inherently different from the clinical setting. Second, although study recruitment resulted in a diverse participant population from 14 states, participants were slightly younger (34 years vs 41 years) and more female (53% vs 36%) than prior national statistics of hospitalists, and the design prevented collection of information on nonresponders. Third, the study focused on the effects of AI predictions and explanations among clinicians who make final diagnostic and treatment decisions. Although radiologists have more training in reading chest radiographs and may be more adept at understanding radiograph explanations, they were not included because they are not ultimately responsible for making these diagnostic and treatment decisions.## ConclusionsStandard AI models’ predictions and explanations improved diagnostic accuracy of clinicians, whereas systematically biased predictions and explanations reduced accuracy. Given the unprecedented pace of AI development, it is essential to carefully test AI integration into clinical workflows. Although the findings of the study suggest that clinicians may not be able to serve as a backstop against flawed AI, they can play an essential role in understanding AI’s limitations.Supplement 1.Trial Protocol (652.8KB, pdf)Supplement 2.Statistical Analysis Plan (295.6KB, pdf)Supplement 3.eMethods.**eFigure 1.** Survey instructions page**eFigure 2.** Clinical Vignette Layout**eFigure 3.** Participant Response Form for all nine vignettes**eFigure 4.** CONSORT Flow diagram of participants through the survey**eTable 1.** Characteristics of the patient population used in the vignettes**eTable 2.** Accuracy and AUROC of the standard model and systematically biased models across the full patient cohort (n=45)**eTable 3.** Count by geographical location of responses across the United States**eTable 4.** P-values for demographic differences between the AI model alone group versus the AI model + explanation group**eTable 5.** Cross-classified generalized random effects model estimates of participant accuracy (%) in diagnosing pneumonia, heart failure, and COPD**eTable 6.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ diagnostic accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of no model input, averaged across all three diagnoses**eTable 7.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ diagnostic accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of systematically biased model, averaged across all three diagnoses**eTable 8.** Pearson’s correlation between participant responses and model scores, with 1000 bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals**eTable 9.** Cross-classified generalized random effects model estimates of participant treatment decision accuracy (%) (align with clinical consult)**eTable 10.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ treatment accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of no model input, averaged across all three treatments**eTable 11.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ treatment accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of incorrect model input, averaged across all three treatments**eFigure 5.** Confusion matrices for the participant responses across vignette settings (2.1MB, pdf)Supplement 4.Data Sharing Statement (15.2KB, pdf)## References- 1.Tschandl P, Rinner C, Apalla Z, et al.

Patients underwent an AI medical interview, after which virtual care providers reviewed the interview summary and AI-provided differential diagnoses, communicated with patients, and finalized diagnoses and treatment plans. Our accuracy measures were agreement between AI diagnoses, virtual care providers, and blind adjudicators. We analyzed AI diagnostic agreement across different diagnoses, presenting symptoms, patient demographic characteristics such as race, and provider levels of experience. We also evaluated model performance improvement with retraining.### ResultsProviders selected an AI diagnosis in 84.2% (n = 85,976) of cases and the top-ranked AI diagnosis in 60.9% (n = 62,130) of cases. Agreement rates varied by diagnosis, with greater than or equal to 95% provider agreement with an AI diagnosis for 35 diagnoses (47% of cases, n = 47,679) and greater than or equal to 90% agreement for 57 diagnoses (69% of cases, n = 70,697). The average agreement rate for half of all presenting symptoms was greater than or equal to 90%. Adjusting for case mix, diagnostic accuracy exhibited minimal variation across demographic characteristics. The adjudicators’ consensus diagnosis, reached in 58.2% (n = 128) of adjudicated cases was always included in the AI differential diagnosis. Provider experience did not affect agreement, and model retraining increased diagnostic accuracy for retrained conditions from 96.6% to 98.0%.### ConclusionOur findings show that agreement between AI and provider diagnoses is high in most cases in the setting of this study. The results highlight the potential for AI to enhance primary care disease diagnosis and patient triage, with the capacity to improve over time.- Previousarticle in issue- Nextarticle in issue## Abbreviations and AcronymsAIartificial intelligenceEMRelectronic medical recordICD-10International Classification of Diseases, 10th RevisionRecommended articles© 2023 The Authors.

It also aims to address the specialties in medicine with greater use of AI.- Research approach: The authors employed a mixed methods approach, combining classical bibliometric analysis and advanced deep learning techniques to analyze PubMed data. They established search criteria to collect papers published in 2023 related to AI and machine learning in health care, identifying subcategories and medical specialties within the dataset.- Research findings: An increase in AI-related health care publications was observed in 2023, with a total of 23,306 articles, which constitutes a 133.7% increase from the previous year. The analysis revealed a differential uptake of AI models across medical fields, with imaging being the most prevalent. The review also noted a spread across various specialties, with cardiology, gastroenterology, ophthalmology, and general clinics being prominent, while psychiatry had fewer publications.- Interesting aspects: The review provided insights into future AI trends in medicine and health care. The growth of image-based publications and the usefulness of AI in specific health care specialties were particularly noted. The review provides a valuable snapshot of AI’s role in health care research in 2023, highlighting the rapid growth and diverse applications of AI technologies across medical specialties. The authors found AI use in imaging was the most prevalent among the specialties and that other fields, such as gastroenterology, ophthalmology, and psychiatry are promising for future use of AI.- Relation to published literature: The authors attempt to establish their review as a foundational reference for the current state of AI in health care literature for the past year and to set the stage for future comparative analyses. However, prior work in reviewing the use of AI in certain medical fields, such as robotics and hospital administration, which are prevalent in the established literature, have not been thoroughly addressed in the paper and could warrant greater discussion.- Strengths and weaknesses: The review’s reproducibility and the use of mixed methods for bibliometric analysis are strengths of the paper. However, the concept of “mature” AI models could use improvement because of its vagueness, and the limited keyword search is a potential weakness. Suggestions for improvement include adhering to reporting guidelines like PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews), clarifying the definition of “mature” research, and considering the inclusion of “healthcare” in the initial search criteria. Additionally, the time frame of a single recent year is very short considering the fact that AI has been around since the 1956 Dartmouth conference and has long been used in the forefront of health research. The authors should consider suggesting that future studies with longer time frames may be carried out as the applications of AI progress over the years.Below we list major and minor concerns that were discussed by participants of the live review, and where possible, we provide suggestions on how to address those issues.## Major Concerns- The authors should more clearly articulate the generalizability to only within the PubMed corpus and, feasibly, within the search results of their query choice. Alternatively, the authors could consider expanding their search terms to include additional relevant keywords to be more holistic of the range of AI uses within health research or expand their database search outside of PubMed to ensure a broader inclusiveness of the literature.- The Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers (BERT)–based maturity classification model and other AI classification methods encountered difficulties in correctly categorizing publications into their medical specialties. This challenge stemmed from BERT’s vocabulary limitations, as it was only trained on a specific set of tokens, making it struggle with unfamiliar or uncommon terms not present in its training data. The observed accuracy of these models ranged from 30% to 68%, suggesting frequent misclassifications or inaccurate categorizations of publication specialties. The authors should consider further improvements and training of AI models to enhance the accuracy of specialty classification and reduce the occurrence of false positives.- The adoption of multimodal models incorporating diverse data types remains restricted, with image data largely prevailing in AI applications within health care, despite the vast array of available data. The authors should consider implementing multimodal models that combine different data formats such as text, tabular, and voice, as this could significantly enhance the effectiveness and adaptability of AI in health care.- Authors should consider how their study deviates from the “gold standard” PRISMA framework and guidelines and discuss why their method would be preferred over PRISMA in this specific case.- The figures need considerable revision before this would be acceptable for publication. Reviewers recommend the following changes:- For Figure 4B, authors should include a definition of terms to make it clear what exactly AI, machine learning, large language model, natural language processing, etc, refers to in context of the papers scoped.- To improve readability, the authors should organize the visualizations under subheaders. For example, Figures 3 and 5 showing visualizations across health care specialties can be grouped together under one subheader.- For Figure 3, imaging should be analyzed separately as it is a major outlier. For example, breaking it down into the specialties in which imaging was applied, as imaging cuts across all specialties (eg, radiology, oncology, histology)- Data and code should be made freely accessible by default and not incumbent on the reader to “request the data” from the authors. The authors should remedy this oversight before submitting for publication.## Minor Concerns- The authors should more carefully define “maturity.” Typically, in AI, maturity refers to a property of how well established the use of AI is within an organization. It is not clear from the paper how that generalizes to a medical field per se.- The paper should lavish more details on the geographic subanalysis and results.- The authors should provide more details on the justification of why they chose the specific search terms used to define the sampling frame. If possible, the authors should point to an empirical determination of why those specific terms were chosen over other reasonably good choices.- Authors should consider providing more details about the papers scoped, for example, distribution across journals/frequency of journals and most common author-provided keywords.- The authors should explain the term “infodemic” as used in the introduction perhaps by referencing the World Health Organization definition.- Authors should provide support for their claims on the “exponential growth of AI,” for example, by referencing past studies or including visualizations to illustrate this.## Concluding RemarksThe reviewers agree that this paper makes an important and timely contribution to the literature. There are several issues that should be addressed prior to finalization of the manuscript—however, the reviewers believe these concerns are easily addressable by the authors.## AcknowledgmentsPREreview and JMIR Publications thank the authors of the preprint for posting their work openly for feedback.

Two UK universities trained the software on a dataset of 800 brain scans of stroke patients and then trialled it on 2,000 patients.The results were impressive. Alongside the AI model\\\\\\'s accuracy, the software was also able to identify the timescale within which the stroke happened - crucial information for professionals.As Dr Paul Bentley, consultant neurologist, told the _Health Tech Newspaper_: “For the majority of strokes caused by a blood clot, if a patient is within 4.5 hours of the stroke happening, he or she is eligible for both medical and surgical treatments. Up to 6 hours, the patient is also eligible for surgical treatment, but after this time point, deciding whether these treatments might be beneficial becomes tricky, as more cases become irreversible. So it’s essential for doctors to know both the initial onset time, as well as whether a stroke could be reversed.”## AI can spot more bone fractures than humans canSurprisingly, urgent care doctors miss broken bones in up to 10% of cases. What’s more, X-ray technicians are both in short supply and overloaded.So using  could potentially avoid both unnecessary X-rays and missed fractures.

Al-antar, who served as the Guest Editor (GE) of this Special Issue, provides an introduction to the Special Issue, outlining the scope of, the significance of, and the emerging trends in the integration of AI and ML in diagnostics. It sets the stage for the subsequent articles by emphasizing the transformative potential of these technologies in healthcare ].Following this, Gil-Rios et al. ] introduce a new method for automatically classifying coronary stenosis using a feature selection technique. Their proposed method achieved a 99% discrimination rate using only four features, suggesting that this method could be useful in a clinical decision support system.Ogunpola et al. ] tackle the global health issue of cardiovascular diseases by focusing on improving early detection, particularly of myocardial infarction, using machine learning. Their study addresses the problem of imbalanced datasets, which can bias predictions, and employs seven classifiers: K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network, Gradient Boost, XGBoost, and Random Forest. The optimized XGBoost model achieved an outstanding performance with an accuracy of 98.50%, a precision of 99.14%, 98.29% recall, and an F1 score of 98.71%, significantly enhancing diagnostic accuracy for heart disease.Lee et al. ] evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of two AI techniques, namely KARA-CXR and ChatGPT, in chest X-ray reading. Using 2000 chest X-ray images, their study assessed accuracy, false findings, location inaccuracies, count inaccuracies, and hallucinations. They found that KARA-CXR significantly outperformed ChatGPT regarding diagnostic accuracy (70.50% vs. 40.50%, according to one observer), false findings, and non-hallucination rate (75% vs. 38%). Both systems showed moderate inter-observer agreement. Their study highlights the superior performance of KARA-CXR in medical imaging diagnostics compared to ChatGPT.Marquez et al. ] focused on using machine learning to differentiate between positive and negative influenza patients in Mexico, where influenza has been a persistent issue since 2009. They used a dataset of 15,480 records from 2010 to 2020, containing clinical and demographic data of patients tested with RT-qPCR. This study evaluated various classification methods and found that Random Forest and Bagging classifiers perform best in terms of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, F1 score, and the AUC. These methods show promise for aiding clinical diagnosis in settings where molecular tests are impractical.Ali et al. ] investigated detecting Parkinson’s disease (PD) using voice attributes from both PD patients and healthy individuals. They employed filter feature selection to remove quasi-constant features and tested several classification models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models, on two datasets. Remarkable results were achieved on Dataset 1, with the Decision Tree and Random Forest methods achieving impressive accuracy. Ensemble learning methods (voting, stacking, and bagging) were applied to further enhance the results, and genetic selection was also tested for accuracy and precision. Their study found higher precision in predicting PD patients and better overall performance when using Dataset 1 compared to Dataset 2.Zakareya et al. ] propose a new deep learning model for breast cancer classification, incorporating features like granular computing and attention mechanisms to achieve enhanced accuracy and reduce the workload of doctors. Their model’s effectiveness is demonstrated by its superior performance compared to other models on two case studies, achieving 93% and 95% accuracy on ultrasound and histopathology images, respectively.Al-rimy et al. ] examined the use of DenseNet169 for knee osteoarthritis detection using X-ray images. An adaptive early-stopping technique with gradual cross-entropy loss estimation is proposed to improve the model’s performance. This approach prevents overfitting and optimizes the number of training epochs. The proposed model demonstrates superior accuracy, precision, recall, and loss compared to existing solutions, indicating the effectiveness of adaptive early stopping and GCE for accurately detecting knee OA.Fatih Uysal ] developed a hybrid artificial intelligence system to detect monkeypox in skin images. An open-source, multi-class image dataset was used, addressing data imbalance through augmentation and preprocessing. State-of-the-art deep learning models were employed for detection, and a unique hybrid model combining high-performing models with LSTM was created. The resulting system achieved 87% test accuracy and a 0.8222 Cohen’s kappa score.Al-Haidari et al. ] propose a new deep learning framework for MR image reconstruction based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) and U-Net. A hybrid spatial and k-space loss function is introduced to improve image quality by minimizing the L1 distance in both spatial and frequency domains. The proposed framework outperformed the traditional SENSE technique and individual U-Net/CGAN models in terms of the PSNR, while maintaining a comparable SSIM. Their CGAN-based framework also showed the best reconstruction performance, proving useful for practical cardiac image reconstruction by providing an enhanced image quality.Bhakar et al. ] reviewed recent computational intelligence-based approaches for identifying disease severity levels. Their study focuses on Parkinson’s disease and diabetic retinopathy, but also briefly covers other diseases. This review examines the methodology, dataset used, and disease type of each approach, evaluating performance metrics such as accuracy and specificity. It also presents public repositories for further research in this field.Alnashwan et al. ] conducted a systematic review to examine the latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and computational intelligence for the detection and treatment of stuttering. They analyzed 14 journal articles from 2019 onward to investigate how AI can accurately determine and classify manifestations of stuttering, as well as how computational intelligence can contribute to developing innovative assessment tools and intervention strategies. Their review highlights the potential of AI and computational intelligence to revolutionize the assessment and treatment of stuttering, enabling personalized and effective approaches for improving the lives of people who have a stutter.## 3. LimitationsAlthough the articles published in this Special Issue present valuable contributions to the field of medical diagnostics leveraging AI and machine learning (ML) techniques, some limitations can be identified across these articles:- (1)Many of these studies have specific focuses or use case scenarios, potentially limiting the generalizability of their findings to broader contexts or populations;- (2)Some articles may have methodological limitations, such as biases in data collection, imbalanced datasets, or reliance on specific classifiers, which could affect the reliability and applicability of their results;- (3)While many studies report impressive results in performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, the evaluation criteria and datasets used may not fully reflect real-world clinical scenarios, leading to potential overestimations of performance;- (4)The interpretation of results may vary across the studies, being potentially influenced by the researchers’ perspectives or biases, which could impact the conclusions drawn from the data.## 4. Future DirectionsMedical image diagnosis powered by artificial intelligence (AI) represents the cutting edge of improvements in healthcare. We should continually strive to enhance the health and wellbeing of our community by providing smart solutions that benefit both patients and physicians. AI technology has significantly advanced medical image diagnosis, improving accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility in healthcare scenarios. AI algorithms can analyze X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, and patient records, such as those of patients with coronary stenosis or Parkinson’s disease, to detect abnormalities such as tumors, fractures, and infections. For example, AI can identify early-stage cancers that might be missed by the human eye. AI can interpret echocardiograms (ECGs) and cardiac MRI scans to detect heart conditions like arrhythmias, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. In light of this, this Special Issue highlights and disseminates the latest breakthroughs in AI-driven diagnostic technologies, with the aim of showcasing innovative research, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and exploring the transformative impact of AI on medical imaging and diagnosis. By bringing together contributions from leading experts, we hope to advance this field of research, improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, and ultimately enhance patient care and health outcomes.The recent rise of large language models (LLMs) like Gemini and medGemini , ] or ChatGPT and BiomedGPT ] presents a transformative opportunity for the healthcare industry, particularly in the realm of diagnosis. These powerful tools can significantly enhance existing diagnostic systems by providing more insightful explanations, ultimately leading to more accurate and efficient patient care. One key contribution of LLMs lies in their ability to generate detailed textual reports. By analyzing vast amounts of medical data, including patient history, test results, and relevant research, LLMs can produce comprehensive reports that not only outline a diagnosis but also explain the reasoning behind it. This detailed explanation assists healthcare professionals by offering a transparent and step-by-step breakdown of how the LLM arrived at its conclusions, fostering trust in the system and allowing doctors to leverage the LLM’s insights while incorporating their own medical expertise. While LLMs cannot directly generate heat maps (i.e., saliency maps) for medical images, they can play a significant role in the process. When integrated with computer vision models, LLMs are able to analyze medical images (X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, etc.), and they can be trained to detect and extract relevant features, anomalies, and patterns from these images. Through this, LLMs have the ability to generate textual descriptions of these highlighted areas that explain why they are important for a certain diagnosis. This provides a form of visual explanation alongside the LLM’s textual report. The combined power of detailed textual explanations and visual heat maps can empower healthcare professionals in several ways:- (1)It improves diagnostic accuracy by offering a comprehensive understanding of the LLM’s reasoning;- (2)It facilitates communication with patients by providing clear and accessible explanations of the diagnostic process , ];- (3)It fosters collaboration between humans and machines, allowing medical professionals to leverage the strengths of LLMs while retaining their own irreplaceable role in healthcare decision making ].However, it is crucial to acknowledge that LLMs are still under development, and their integration into healthcare systems requires careful consideration. Ensuring data privacy and security is paramount, and ongoing human oversight remains essential. In conclusion, LLM-based tools like Gemini and GPTs (Generative Pre-Trained Transformers) hold immense potential to revolutionize healthcare diagnostics. As mentioned above, the detailed textual explanations and visual heat maps provided by these tools can empower healthcare professionals by allowing them gain a deeper understanding of the diagnostic process, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency in patient care. As LLM technology continues to evolve, the future of healthcare diagnosis promises to be one of increased transparency, collaboration, and, ultimately, improved patient outcomes. The development of robust medical XAI models is often hindered by the limited availability of labeled datasets, particularly for rare diseases or specific imaging modalities. Generative AI techniques ] offer promising solutions to address this challenge, enabling the creation of synthetic medical data across various modalities—text, images, signals, etc. LLMs like GPT-3 excel at generating synthetic patient records that closely mimic the structure, terminology, and statistical distributions of real clinical notes. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have revolutionized medical image synthesis, producing realistic X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans that can incorporate specific anatomical variations or pathologies. This not only increases the size of datasets but allows researchers to simulate diverse disease presentations. Additionally, GANs can augment datasets by introducing realistic variations to existing images or even by translating images between modalities (e.g., generating a potential CT scan from an MRI scan), reducing the reliance on acquiring data in multiple ways. Generative models are able to synthesize physiological signals like ECGs, EEGs, and others, replicating real-world patterns and anomalies. This can be leveraged to expand training data for diagnostic models and facilitate the development of monitoring devices. Furthermore, generative AI can create hybrid signals with controlled variations, simulating complex or unusual health conditions to diversify training data.Finally, we can potentially leverage contrastive learning ] to address the challenge of data-labeling exhaustion in the development of LLM-based tools similar to medGemini or BiomedGPT. Contrastive learning is a technique within self-supervised learning where a machine learning model learns by creating its own supervisory signals from unlabeled data. The primary goal of this is to train a model to recognize similarities and differences between data samples: the model learns an embedding space (a kind of representational map) where similar items are clustered together and dissimilar items are far apart. Meanwhile, deep active learning could prove to be capable of supporting and automating the process of labeling medical data.## 5. ConclusionsIn conclusion, this Special Issue underscores the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in medical diagnostics, as evidenced by the collection of cutting-edge research it presents. While these advancements offer unprecedented accuracy and efficiency in disease detection and treatment planning across various medical fields, including radiology, pathology, genomics, and personalized medicine, several limitations persist. These limitations include the potential lack of generalizability, methodological constraints, and the need for the careful interpretation of results. Looking ahead, the integration of large language models (LLMs) like Gemini and medGemini holds promise for further revolutionizing healthcare diagnosis through empowering healthcare professionals with detailed textual explanations and visual heat maps to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis. Despite these advancements, however, ongoing considerations for data privacy, security, and human oversight are essential. Ultimately, the future of healthcare diagnosis promises increased transparency, collaboration, and improved patient outcomes as AI technology continues to evolve and move forward to address current challenges.## AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) for providing support by means of a wide range of research grants from the Korean government (MSIT) (No. RS-2022-00166402 and RS-2023-00256517) for improving AI-based medical diagnostics.

And yet, \"AI digital health solutions hold the potential to enhance efficiency, reduce costs and improve health outcomes globally,\" says the white paper. Here are seven examples of AI technologies already making a difference in the medical field.AI and healthcare2018201920202021202220232024Year010864212Billions $A Flourish chart]( AI can interpret brain scansA new AI software is \" \" as professionals at examining the brain scans of stroke patients. Two UK universities trained the software on a dataset of 800 brain scans of stroke patients and then trialled it on 2,000 patients.The results were impressive. Alongside the AI model\\'s accuracy, the software was also able to identify the timescale within which the stroke happened - crucial information for professionals.As Dr Paul Bentley, consultant neurologist, told the _Health Tech Newspaper_: “For the majority of strokes caused by a blood clot, if a patient is within 4.5 hours of the stroke happening, he or she is eligible for both medical and surgical treatments. Up to 6 hours, the patient is also eligible for surgical treatment, but after this time point, deciding whether these treatments might be beneficial becomes tricky, as more cases become irreversible. So it’s essential for doctors to know both the initial onset time, as well as whether a stroke could be reversed.”## AI can spot more bone fractures than humans canSurprisingly, urgent care doctors miss broken bones in up to 10% of cases. What’s more, X-ray technicians are both in short supply and overloaded.So using  could potentially avoid both unnecessary X-rays and missed fractures. The UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says the technology is safe, reliable and could reduce the need for follow-up appointments.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesBut there are concerns around the fast rollout of AI in healthcare.\"It is important that people using these tools are properly trained in doing so, meaning they  from technological limitations ... such as the possibility for wrong information being given,\" Dr Caroline Green of the Institute for Ethics in AI at the University of Oxford told the BBC.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum creating guardrails for Artificial Intelligence?Show moreIn response to the uncertainties surrounding generative AI and the need for robust AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes for all, the Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) has launched the .The Alliance unites industry leaders, governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations to champion responsible global design and release of transparent and inclusive AI systems.This includes the workstreams part of the , in collaboration with the Centre for Energy and Materials, the Centre for Advanced Manufacturing and Supply Chains, the Centre for Cybersecurity, the Centre for Nature and Climate, and the Global Industries team.## Assessing ambulance needs with AIIn the UK, around  are taken by ambulance to hospital each month. It’s down to paramedics to decide who does or doesn’t need to go, and always with an awareness of how few beds are available.A study in Yorkshire in the north of England found that in 80% of cases . The AI model was trained on factors such as a patient’s mobility, pulse and blood oxygen levels and chest pain – it also proved to respond without bias. NICE did caution, however, that before being put into more widespread use, more training was needed.## Detecting early signs of more than 1,000 diseasesA new AI machine learning model can  before the patient is even aware of any symptoms, according to its maker AstraZeneca.Using medical data from 500,000 people who are part of a UK health data repository, the machine could “predict with high confidence a disease diagnosis many years later”.Slavé Petrovski, who led the research, told Sky News: \"For many of these diseases, by the time they manifest clinically and the individual goes to the doctor because of an ailment or visible observation, that is far down the line from when the disease process began.“We can pick up signatures in an individual that are highly predictive of developing , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney disease and many others,\" he said.Another UK study has found that an AI tool can successfully detect . Trained on the MRI scans of over 1,100 adults and children globally, the AI tool was able to spot lesions more quickly than a doctor, but also discover tiny or obscured ones that had evaded the human eye.\" ,\" lead researcher Dr Konrad Wagstyl told the BBC. \"AI can find about two-thirds that doctors miss - but a third are still really difficult to find.\" Combining AI\\'s findings with human oversight and expertise has the potential to speed up both diagnosis and cure, the researchers say.0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 90%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabledShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?Play/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume↑Decrease Volume↓Seek Forward→Seek Backward←Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemDecrease Caption Size-Increase Caption Size+ or =Seek %0-9Live00:0000:0000:00## Clinical chatbots to guide healthcare decisionsDoctors must make informed, swift medical decisions: AI could potentially speed these up, but it could also provide unreliable or biased information.A US study found that standard large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude or Gemini were unable to provide clinicians with sufficiently relevant or evidence-based answers to their medical questions. But ChatRWD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system – which essentially combines LLMs with retrieval systems to improve output – produced useful answers to  (compared with 2%-10% for the LLMs).Digital interfaces are increasingly being rolled out to help triage patients, too. In an , part of the World Economic Forum’s , a case study on digital patient platform Huma, revealed it could reduce readmission rates by 30%, time spent reviewing patients by up to 40% and “alleviated the workload of healthcare providers”.The report anticipates a future in which technologies like these could “dramatically transform the patient experience. People who are generally healthy can use self-monitoring devices to optimize their mental and physical health, while those with health issues will have access to a wide range of digital solutions”.## AI and traditional medicinePracticed in 170 countries and used by billions of people, traditional medicine has maintained its relevance in the modern world in part because of its emphasis on a holistic approach to healthcare. And while . A new brief from the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, \\'Mapping the application of artificial intelligence in traditional medicine\\', shows how  (TCIM) while protecting cultural heritage.India is the first country to launch a , utilizing AI tools to catalogue and analyze indigenous medical texts. The country is also exploring how AI and Ayurgenomics - a field which combines the ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda with modern genomics - can intersect, to see what herbal formulations could help tackle modern diseases.Similarly, , while in South Korea, AI is being used to analyze traditional medicine compounds to treat blood disorders.The global TCIM market is expected to reach nearly $600 billion in 2025 - and AI looks set to accelerate that market further and faster. The new brief stresses the importance of safeguarding  in the process.“AI must not become a new frontier for exploitation,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Systems. “We must ensure that Indigenous Peoples and local communities are not only protected but are active partners in shaping the future of AI in traditional medicine.”##### Have you read?- ##### - ##### - ##### ## AI for healthcare adminAdministrative tasks are both inevitable and time-consuming in the medical field. Using AI co-pilots could free up clinicians to focus more of their time on patients.Microsoft has recently announced its , an AI healthcare tool that can listen to, and create notes on, clinical consultations. And  already has a suite of AI models specifically tailored to alleviate some of the administrative burdens in healthcare. In Germany, an AI platform called  has cut testing and diagnosis times from weeks to hours and its founders are determined to show that the technology \"can be an ally, not an obstacle\". Co-founder Dr Sebastian Casu told EU-Startups: \"No one joins the healthcare sector to spend hours on admin\".Of course, having an AI tool listening in and taking notes on your doctor\\'s appointment will not appeal to everyone. A recent study in the UK found that just  (although over two-thirds are comfortable with the technology being used to free up professionals\\' time). Then there is the question of accuracy. A report last year found that OpenAI\\'s Whisper, used by many hospitals to summarize patient meetings, was .This is why regulation of AI tools is so vital. In the UK, AI-powered medical devices are strictly regulated by the .). In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last year  and concluded that, while the FDA will “continue to play a central role in ensuring safe, effective, and trustworthy AI tools” it was also essential that “all involved entities … attend to AI with the rigour this transformative technology merits”.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookies##### Don\\'t miss any update on this topicCreate a free account and access your personalized content collection with our latest publications and analyses.License and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.##### Share:!## Forum StoriesnewsletterBringing you weekly curated insights and analysis on the global issues that matter.### More onHealth and Healthcare Systems      Camila Pintarelli and Thomas OxleyOctober 9, 2025Bushra AlBlooshi, Hoda Al Khzaimi and Heba AhmadOctober 8, 2025Hoda Al Khzaimi, Bushra AlBlooshi and Heba AhmadOctober 7, 2025Joan-Paula Bor and Kathleen SchmelerOctober 6, 2025Naoko TochibayashiOctober 3, 2025Oct 2, 2025EN   Remove menu'}, {'title': 'Improving Patient Care and Safety With AI - Healthcare Executive', 'url': 'https://www.healthcareexecutive.org/archives/march-april-2024/improving-patient-care--and-safety-with-ai', 'markdown': 'By Topic: TechnologyInformation ManagementSafety QualityBy Collection: Safety![]( intelligence has demonstrated that it can improve patient care and safety by helping clinicians analyze imaging and pathology reports.\\xa0Many applications, though, are still in the early stages of development and adoption, especially in the automation of administrative tasks.“For quality care, I believe AI allows us to augment clinical decision-making,” says Sachin Shah, MD, an associate professor of medicine and pediatrics and chief medical information officer at UChicago Medicine in Chicago. He notes there is a sizable predictive analytics and machine learning space that can significantly leverage the large amount of data available. As a result, “we can better identify patterns, predict health issues and customize treatment plans,” Shah says.Achieving that level of precision and personalization at the patient level will help improve outcomes and streamline many care-delivery processes, according to Shah.Patient safety is also enhanced by AI’s capacity to analyze vast volumes of data in real time. “This can lead to early detection of clinical deterioration, intervention ahead of potential adverse drug reactions and an overall reduction of medical errors,” Shah says. “Clinicians are alerted sooner that something may be trending in the wrong direction, well before it may become clinically evident.”### AI’s PotentialRichard Greenhill, DHA, CPHQ, FACHE, director of the undergraduate healthcare management program in the School of Health Professions at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, says high-quality healthcare depends on reliable and accurate processes in the delivery of patient care “to ensure that safety is prioritized for sustainable outcomes. Process variation is the enemy of quality, so the tools of AI are exciting because they can undertake some of the more routine and repeatable processes that are susceptible to the impact of human factors.”The TTUHSC Institute of Telehealth and Digital Innovation was established in September 2023 to create a digital health ecosystem, where technologies such as AI transform care delivery in West Texas. “AI has the potential to unleash new ways of approaching performance improvement and patient safety as we begin to tap into the universe of data that encompasses health—both inside and outside of the delivery system,” says Greenhill.Systems thinking is also an important component of quality care. “Systems thinking in care delivery helps us focus on interrelationships in processes to solve complex problems in our quality improvement strategy,” Greenhill explains. “This is why we should not ever first blame people when a medical mistake or undesired event occurs. A system produces the results for which it was designed. Thus, a person or a tool, such as AI in our delivery system, can never itself be the focus when an error occurs.”Healthcare facilities must look deeply at the design\\xa0of how these resources were planned for and supported in their activities, according to Greenhill. AI allows\\xa0“us to look across interprofessional processes and aggregate datasets to discover insights that we may not\\xa0have assumed.” Examples include early detection via analysis of diagnostic studies, such as radiology and clinical lab, and more quickly identifying high-risk patients based on treatment and disease progression. “AI can assist quality professionals, clinicians and\\xa0leaders to make sense of the complexities in our systems in managing risks associated with handoffs,\\xa0care coordination and treatment interventions,” Greenhill says.AI can enhance patient care in everything from ophthalmology to cardiology and pathology/oncology to psychiatry, according to Thomas Fuchs, DrSc, dean of the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine in New York City. “AI should help physicians to be faster and more effective, do new things they currently cannot do and reduce burnout,” he says.Even before the AI department was established in the fall of 2021, Mount Sinai was testing AI systems in the ICU to alert nurses to patient risk of malnutrition, deterioration or fall, along with reducing false alarms and staff overhead. The AI system takes information from the EHR and various devices in the ICU.Cancer detection. AI has also benefited pathology at Mount Sinai by detecting cancer and grading cancer earlier than before. The institution has developed an AI foundation model based on 3 billion images from 400,000 digital microscopy slides of cancer biopsies and resections. “The model can detect biomarkers to predict what cancer treatment will work for a specific patient,” Fuchs says.Diagnostic imaging assisted by AI holds promise, as well. A retrospective study published online in European Radiology in March 2023 concluded that among more than 1,200 breast cancer cases in Norway, an AI system scored 93% of the screen-detected cancers and 40% of the interval cancers with an AI score of 10 (on a scale of 1 to 10, based on the risk of malignancy). Furthermore, the AI system scored all screen-detected cancers and nearly 50% of interval cancers in women with the highest breast density with an AI score of 10. This resulted in a sensitivity of 80.9% for women with the highest breast density for the AI system, compared to 62.8% for independent double reading by radiologists.Roughly 40% of the screen-detected cancers achieved an AI score of 10 on the prior mammograms, indicating a potential for earlier detection by using AI in screen-reading.Physicians at the Breast Center at Mount Sinai Medical Center believe that the use of AI for detecting new abnormalities in mammograms and MRI scans is promising. They also predict that AI will help radiologists interpret mammograms while reducing the number of false positive interpretations, thus avoiding unnecessary biopsies. However, further research is needed to ensure the technology’s reliability and the anticipated benefits.Informatics. Excitement about the potential for AI led the University of Kentucky to form a multidisciplinary collaborative of physicians, data scientists, biomedical engineers and others to form the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Alliance. After two years of success in starting projects around radiology, pharmacy and cancer, the alliance merged in 2022 with an innovations program to form the Center for Applied AI within biomedical informatics for even broader AI applications across healthcare and the university. Most AI healthcare initiatives at the university hospital stem from a desire to improve quality of care and reporting, such as better implementing the recommendation from the Society of Thoracic Surgery that a patient take a beta-blocker within 24 hours of surgery. Using tools already developed or in development in one discipline allows center members to more quickly apply solutions to other projects.A chatbot is being developed at the college that will connect with patients preparing to undergo cardiac surgery. The chatbot would help guide patients on when to take their medicine and help answer questions they may have about the surgery.Over the past year, there has been a rapid increase in the optimization of administrative tasks completed via AI, including documentation, prior authorizations and revenue cycling. “We are also able to better communicate with our patients and give our patients more self-efficacy,” Shah of UChicago Medicine says. “Conversational AI is very well suited to replace many of the burdensome nonclinical tasks that do not require clinical judgement.AI offers an opportunity to enhance quality care by augmenting clinical decision-making, according to Shah. “Through predictive analytics and machine learning, we can leverage vast amounts of data to identify patterns, predict potential health issues and customize treatment plans for individual patients. This personalization can significantly improve outcomes and streamline care delivery processes.”Similarly, AI’s role in patient safety “lies in its ability to analyze data in real time, allowing for early detection of potential risks such as adverse drug interactions or deteriorating patient condition,” Shah says. AI-powered systems can also assist in proactive interventions, thus reducing medical errors and ensuring timely and accurate care, all of which ultimately safeguard patient well-being.UChicago Medicine is scheduled to begin a pilot study this spring comprising 250 of its physicians to leverage generative AI to streamline and take over much of the clinical documentation.Some EHR providers include AI algorithms in their products, according to Greenhill. “These tools show promise to augment and enhance work for clinicians,” he says. “However, as these tools become more widely used, we need to maintain vigilance about the risk that they pose to patients and processes due to model and data bias.”AI chatbots—automated software applications—can perform many mundane tasks and reduce the burden on staff, physicians and nurses so they can pursue “the meaningful work they signed up to do, such as physicians spending more time with patients,” Greenhill says.“If a human does the same task 10 times every hour,\\xa0he or she is more likely to make a mistake due to a\\xa0host of human factors,” Greenhill says. By contrast,\\xa0AI chatbots can operate nonstop, requiring neither breaks nor rest. “This is a win in the war on process variation,” he says.Surgical care. Danielle Walsh, MD, FAAP, FACS, a professor of surgery and vice chair of Surgery for Quality and Process Improvement at the University\\xa0of Kentucky College of Medicine in Lexington, was part of a panel of surgeons who discussed the impact\\xa0of AI on surgical practices at the American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress 2023 in October. By allowing AI to take over many of the repetitive and rote administrative tasks that burden physicians, “the physician can perform more cognitive decision-making and focus more on human connections and time spent with patients,” says Walsh.AI will also play a major role in mandatory reporting of quality metrics to governmental and other entities, according to Walsh, freeing up even more staff members to perform more substantial work to truly improve quality of care. A study published online in JAMA Network in June 2023 on resources spent on just measuring and reporting data on 162 unique quality metrics found that an estimated 108,478 person-hours with a personnel cost of $5 million and another $603,000 in vendor fees were required. “Those funds are better spent on interventions than reporting,” Walsh says.AI tools also can communicate with a patient at home to ensure drug adherence, collect feedback on how patients are feeling, and use that feedback to become more connected with the patient in between visits or after discharge from the hospital. “And if you add in digital sensors, we can do tremendous monitoring at home,” Walsh says. “During COVID, people at home were at ICU-level care.”A patient with a blood vessel bypassed in the leg, for example, could wear a sock with a sensor at home to detect if blood flow begins to decrease before the blood vessel blocks off again and before the patient develops a blue, painful foot. “AI combined with sensors will allow us to intervene earlier and prevent more serious complications,” Walsh says.### Looking ForwardAs for AI cost, some healthcare facilities already have 5G network capability, along with modern wiring and systems that are compatible with AI, while others will need to invest in infrastructure improvements. “There will also be tradeoffs,” Walsh says. “Because AI requires a tremendous amount of computing power, you are not going to be able to run every AI algorithm simultaneously. And as the area grows, you will need to prioritize AI systems that meet the needs of a specific institution and the specific patient population being served.”Which areas of AI to pursue differ by organization and their culture, according to Shah, and are determined by staffing and the ability of teams and leadership to adjust. “There is not necessarily a lot of replacement of human expertise coming, but certainly a lot of reallocating human resources to different work that is ideally more top-of-license work, by automating some of the repetitive administrative tasks and algorithmic work,” he says.However, the quality of the output from AI is contingent on the quality of data entered, “so you need to invest a lot into your data infrastructure,” Shah says. “The quality of your data needs to be high.”There are also ethical considerations. “There has to be clear transparency around the decision-making in these models,” Shah says. “The concept of algorithmic bias is really important to understand and to ensure we are minimizing. Humans need to be at the center to carefully scrutinize any potential bias by closely monitoring the inputs, the algorithms and outputs to ensure they are not leading to unintended consequences.”_Bob Kronemyer is a freelance writer based in Elkhart, Ind._### Acceptance and Implementation StrategiesDanielle Walsh, MD, FAAP, FACS, a professor of surgery and vice chair of Surgery for Quality and Process Improvement at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine in Lexington, believes there are two big myths about using AI in healthcare: that physicians don’t want AI and that patients don’t want AI.****'}]\n",

However, accuracy significantly decreased by 11.3% when clinicians were shown systematically biased AI model predictions and model explanations did not mitigate the negative effects of such predictions.### MeaningAI model explanations did not help clinicians recognize systematically biased AI models.## Abstract### ImportanceArtificial intelligence (AI) could support clinicians when diagnosing hospitalized patients; however, systematic bias in AI models could worsen clinician diagnostic accuracy. Recent regulatory guidance has called for AI models to include explanations to mitigate errors made by models, but the effectiveness of this strategy has not been established.### ObjectivesTo evaluate the impact of systematically biased AI on clinician diagnostic accuracy and to determine if image-based AI model explanations can mitigate model errors.### Design, Setting, and ParticipantsRandomized clinical vignette survey study administered between April 2022 and January 2023 across 13 US states involving hospitalist physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants.### InterventionsClinicians were shown 9 clinical vignettes of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory failure, including their presenting symptoms, physical examination, laboratory results, and chest radiographs. Clinicians were then asked to determine the likelihood of pneumonia, heart failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as the underlying cause(s) of each patient’s acute respiratory failure. To establish baseline diagnostic accuracy, clinicians were shown 2 vignettes without AI model input. Clinicians were then randomized to see 6 vignettes with AI model input with or without AI model explanations. Among these 6 vignettes, 3 vignettes included standard-model predictions, and 3 vignettes included systematically biased model predictions.### Main Outcomes and MeasuresClinician diagnostic accuracy for pneumonia, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.### ResultsMedian participant age was 34 years (IQR, 31-39) and 241 (57.7%) were female. Four hundred fifty-seven clinicians were randomized and completed at least 1 vignette, with 231 randomized to AI model predictions without explanations, and 226 randomized to AI model predictions with explanations. Clinicians’ baseline diagnostic accuracy was 73.0% (95% CI, 68.3% to 77.8%) for the 3 diagnoses. When shown a standard AI model without explanations, clinician accuracy increased over baseline by 2.9 percentage points (95% CI, 0.5 to 5.2) and by 4.4 percentage points (95% CI, 2.0 to 6.9) when clinicians were also shown AI model explanations. Systematically biased AI model predictions decreased clinician accuracy by 11.3 percentage points (95% CI, 7.2 to 15.5) compared with baseline and providing biased AI model predictions with explanations decreased clinician accuracy by 9.1 percentage points (95% CI, 4.9 to 13.2) compared with baseline, representing a nonsignificant improvement of 2.3 percentage points (95% CI, −2.7 to 7.2) compared with the systematically biased AI model.### Conclusions and RelevanceAlthough standard AI models improve diagnostic accuracy, systematically biased AI models reduced diagnostic accuracy, and commonly used image-based AI model explanations did not mitigate this harmful effect.### Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: * * *This randomized clinical vignette study examines whether providing AI explanations to biased AI models enhances clinician diagnostic accuracy.## IntroductionArtificial intelligence (AI) shows promise in identifying abnormalities in clinical images, such as pneumonia from chest radiographs, diabetic retinopathy from fundus images, or skin cancer from histopathology images., , ,  AI models in clinical care analyze patient data, identify patterns, and make predictions. Integrating AI into clinical decision-making may result in higher accuracy than a clinician without AI. However, systematically biased AI models (ie, models that consistently misdiagnose patient subpopulations) can lead to errors and potential harm., ,  For example, an AI model trained on data in which female patients are consistently underdiagnosed for heart disease may learn this bias and underdiagnose females if deployed. Physician performance can be harmed by following incorrect predictions, a phenomenon known as _overreliance_. Ideally, clinicians would be able to follow AI predictions when correct but ignore incorrect AI predictions. However, the extent to which AI can be safely integrated to support diagnostic decisions is still largely unknown.Recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance highlights the importance of providing clinicians with the ability to independently review the basis for software recommendations, including the information and logic used in a model’s decisions. Although AI developers frequently use AI explanations to debug models during development, providing similar explanations to clinicians, as recommended by the FDA, could potentially enhance interpretability after deployment. Explanations could help clinicians better understand a model’s logic before acting on its recommendation, helping to mitigate errors made by systematically biased models. For example, image-based explanations designed to highlight important regions of an image that were used in an AI model’s decision could help clinicians identify when models are behaving inaccurately.To determine if providing AI explanations could enhance clinician diagnostic accuracy and alleviate the negative impact of systematically biased models, we conducted a randomized clinical vignette web-based survey study. We focused on the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure as a test case for this broader challenge because acute respiratory failure is commonly encountered in practice, often misdiagnosed, and evaluated using commonly encountered data such as chest radiographs that AI tools can analyze. We presented participants with standard and systematically biased AI, randomizing participants to see AI predictions alone or AI predictions with explanations. This design allowed us to test our hypothesis that systematically biased models would harm clinician diagnostic accuracy, but commonly used image-based explanations would help clinicians partially recover their performance.## Methods### ParticipantsWe recruited hospitalist physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants who commonly care for patients with acute respiratory failure to complete the study. The study protocol is available in  and the statistical analysis plan in . We first identified 12 hospitalist leaders as site champions through interaction with the Society of Hospital Medicine research committee and the authors’ personal contacts. Site champions advertised the study via email to their local hospital medicine divisions. Each site champion sent a follow-up reminder email after 2 weeks. Interested participants were directed to the study landing page, which confirmed study eligibility, provided additional study information, study instructions, and obtained informed consent prior to randomization (see the study protocol in  and eFigure 1 in ). Participants were offered a $50 gift card for completing the study.This study was deemed exempt by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. Although the study was not registered initially given its vignette-based design, to ensure it was appropriately reflected in the trial literature, it was registered on ClinicialTrials.gov after its completion with the registration parameters based on the prespecified protocol.### Clinical VignettesWe created 45 clinical vignettes based on patients hospitalized with acute respiratory failure in 2017 at the University of Michigan. Patients were selected to achieve study goals while being representative of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory failure (see eMethods in ). A study team member reviewed each patient’s chart to create a succinct version of the patient’s presenting history, past medical history, current medications, physical examination findings, laboratory findings, and chest radiograph for each vignette (eFigure 2 in ). At least 4 pulmonary physicians independently reviewed each patient’s complete medical record to determine if pneumonia, heart failure, and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was the patient’s underlying diagnosis.Each vignette had 3 reference diagnostic labels pertaining to pneumonia, heart failure, and COPD based on the average of these reviews, and each reference label was binary, indicating whether the disease was present or absent. See eTable 1 in  for patient characteristics for additional details.### Study DesignThe survey was conducted using a Qualtrics survey tool. Participants were assigned 9 of 45 clinical vignettes to review. All participants followed the same vignette order: 2 vignettes without AI predictions, 6 vignettes with AI predictions, and 1 vignette with a clinical consultation by a hypothetical colleague ( ). Upon study initiation, all participants were randomized to AI predictions with or without AI explanations for all 6 AI vignettes, and all participants were also randomized to see 1 of 3 types of systematically biased AI models during 3 of the 6 AI vignettes.#### Figure 1. Randomization and Study Flow Diagram for the 9 Clinical Vignettes.]( in a new tab]( completing informed consent, participants were randomized to artificial intelligence (AI) predictions with or without explanations and all participants were also randomized to 1 of 3 types of systematically biased AI models during a subset of vignettes in the study. The 3 systematically biased AI models included a model predicting pneumonia if aged 80 years or older, a model predicting heart failure if body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 30 or higher, and a model predicting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) if a blur was applied to the radiograph. Participants were first shown 2 vignettes without AI predictions to measure baseline diagnostic accuracy. The next 6 vignettes included AI predictions. If the participant was randomized to see AI explanations, the participant was also shown an AI model explanation with the AI predictions. Three vignettes had standard AI predictions, and 3 had biased AI predictions shown in random order. The final vignette included a clinical consultation, a short narrative provided by a hypothetical trusted colleague who identified the correct diagnosis and their diagnostic rationale.The first 2 vignettes did not include AI predictions and were used to measure baseline diagnostic accuracy. The next 6 vignettes included AI predictions immediately after the patient case. If randomized to see AI explanations, the participant was also shown an image-based AI model explanation alongside the AI predictions. Three vignettes had standard AI predictions and 3 had biased predictions shown in random order. The final vignette included a clinical consultation, a short narrative provided by a hypothetical trusted colleague describing the rationale behind the most likely diagnosis and recommended treatments. By design, the clinical consultation vignette always recommended the correct diagnosis and treatment, serving as a realistic upper bound of participant diagnostic accuracy when provided accurate recommendations.After each vignette, participants were asked to separately assess how likely pneumonia, heart failure, or COPD was contributing to the patient’s respiratory failure on a scale of 0 to 100 (eFigure 3 in ). Responses were collected on a continuous scale to calculate the correlation between AI model scores and participant responses. In calculating accuracy, responses of 50 or higher were considered positive for the diagnosis. Patients could have 1, more than 1, or none of the conditions. After completing the diagnostic assessment, participants were asked whether they would administer any combination of steroids, antibiotics, intravenous (IV) diuretics, or none of these treatments to the patient.### Standard and Systematically Biased AI Model Predictions and ExplanationsWhen participants were shown AI predictions, the model provided a score for each diagnosis on a scale of 0 to 100 estimating how likely the patient’s symptoms were due to pneumonia, heart failure, and COPD ( ). Standard AI predictions were generated using a machine learning model trained using standard approaches on a separate data set. All participants were randomized to see 1 of 3 systematically biased AI models: (1) a model predicting a high likelihood of pneumonia for a patient who was 80 years or older; (2) a model predicting a high likelihood of heart failure if a patient’s body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 30 or higher; and (3) a model predicting a high likelihood of COPD if a blur was applied to the radiograph (eMethods in ). Vignettes with biased models were shown for patients with attributes leading the biased model to predict the diagnosis with high likelihood. For example, a participant randomized to see the model biased for age was shown vignettes of patients 80 years or older with the biased model, and the model displayed a high likelihood prediction for pneumonia and standard predictions for the 2 other diagnoses.#### Figure 2. Examples of Model Predictions and Explanations for Standard and Systematically Biased AI Models for Patients.!Patient 1 is an 81-year-old male with respiratory failure from heart failure. A, The standard AI model correctly diagnosed heart failure as the cause of acute respiratory failure and provided an explanation highlighting areas in the chest radiograph used to make the prediction. B, The systematically biased AI model incorrectly diagnosed pneumonia as the cause of acute respiratory failure due to the patient’s age and provided an explanation highlighting irrelevant features in the chest radiograph. Standard-model predictions for heart failure (the correct diagnosis) are also provided.Patient 2 is an 88-year-old female with respiratory failure from COPD. C, The standard AI model incorrectly diagnosed pneumonia and correctly diagnosed COPD as the cause of respiratory failure and provided reasonable explanations. D, The biased AI model incorrectly diagnosed pneumonia as the cause of respiratory failure due to patient age and provided an explanation highlighting irrelevant features in the chest radiograph. Standard-model predictions for COPD (the correct diagnosis) are also provided.For participants randomized to explanations, explanations were presented when the AI model provided a score of 50 or higher (corresponding to positive diagnosis). Explanations were shown as Grad-CAM heatmaps overlaid on the chest radiograph that highlighted which regions of the image most affecting the model’s prediction ( ). Explanations generated from the standard model highlighted clinically meaningful regions on the chest radiograph (eg, lungs). Explanations associated with the systematically biased models highlighted areas of the radiograph corresponding to age, BMI, or preprocessing (eg, low bone density, soft tissue; ; and see eMethods in  3 for details of how biased model explanations were generated). Because the biased models always made positive predictions, participants randomized to explanations were always shown explanations with biased predictions. In contrast, when shown standard-model predictions, explanations were shown with 17 pneumonia predictions (38%) , 18 heart failure predictions (40%), and 9 COPD predictions (20%).By design, the standard model had an overall accuracy of 75% and the biased models had overall accuracy of 70% (eTable 2 in ), which is on par with physicians and reflects the difficulty of the diagnostic tasks. Therefore, such models would likely meet specifications by regulators for approval. However, among the subset of patients for whom the biased models made biased predictions, the biased models were 33% accurate, whereas the standard model was 67% accurate.### Participant DemographicsAfter completing the vignettes, participant demographic information, including self-reported gender, race, and ethnicity, was collected to assess sample diversity and representativeness. Participants were also asked about AI knowledge (see eMethods for the postsurvey questions in ).### Study OutcomesThe primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy between vignette settings, defined as the number of correct diagnostic assessments over the total number of assessments. Participants made 3 separate assessments in each vignette, 1 for each diagnosis. If the participant’s assessment agreed with the reference label, the diagnostic assessment was correct. Overall accuracy was calculated using assessments for all diagnoses. Accuracy for a specific diagnosis was calculated using assessments relevant to the specific diagnosis.In vignettes with biased model predictions, the biased model provided a prediction for the diagnosis for which it was biased and standard predictions for the 2 other diagnoses. Although participants made 3 diagnostic assessments in those vignettes, only diagnostic assessments corresponding to the biased predictions were included in the accuracy calculation.Secondary outcomes included treatment selection accuracy, correlation between participants’ diagnostic assessment scores and model scores, and confusion matrices across vignette settings.### Statistical AnalysisThe primary preplanned analysis compared diagnostic accuracy between the clinician baseline and each AI model vignette setting. This analysis sought to specifically determine (1) whether standard AI improved clinician accuracy, (2) whether standard AI with explanations improved accuracy, (3) whether biased AI hurt diagnostic accuracy, and (4) whether biased AI with explanations helped clinicians recover from the biased predictions.Completed vignettes were included in the analysis regardless of whether a participant completed all 9 vignettes. Diagnostic accuracy across vignette settings was compared by fitting a cross-classified, generalized, random-effects model, in which individual diagnostic assessments were nested within study participants and patients. The outcome was a binary variable indicating whether the diagnostic assessment was correct and the exposure was the specific vignette setting for which the assessment was performed. Predictive margins and contrasts were calculated to estimate accuracy at each vignette setting, and differences between settings, with 95% CIs were calculated using the delta method.Exploratory subgroup analyses were also conducted by specific diagnosis, clinician profession, and participant’s prior interactions with clinical decision support. A secondary analysis was conducted to understand the effect of correct and incorrect model predictions on treatment selection accuracy.We aimed to recruit 400 participants based on simulation-based power calculations. The simulation ensured adequate power to detect a 20% decrease in accuracy with the systematically biased AI model compared with baseline and 10% improvement with AI explanations (eMethods in  3 and the statistical analysis plan in ). Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 16 (StataCorp). Statistical significance was based on a _P_ value <.05. _P_ values for multiple comparisons were not adjusted in the preplanned analyses.## ResultsOf 1024 participants who viewed the study information page, 572 (56%) initiated the study and were randomized ( ; eFigure 4 in ). Four hundred fifty-seven participants completed at least 1 vignette and were included in the primary analysis, including 226 randomized to AI model and explanations. Four hundred eighteen participants completed all 9 vignettes. Study participants were from 13 US states (eTable 3 in ). Participant demographics did not meaningfully differ across randomization groups (eTable 4 in ). The majority (97.6%) of participants’ general practice area was hospital medicine. The median age was 34 years (IQR, 31-39); 241 participants (57.7%) were female; and 19.1% of participants self-reported as Asian, 1.7% as Black, and 68.1% as White. Of all the participants, 31.6% of had previously interacted with clinical decision support tools and 66.7% were unaware that AI could be systematically biased based on patient demographics.### Table.

Providing standard AI predictions with explanations increased accuracy to 77.5% (95% CI, 73.0%-82.0%), an increase of 4.4 percentage points from baseline (95% CI, 2.0-6.9; _P_\\u2009<\\u2009.001; ; eTables 5 and 6 in ). Participant diagnostic accuracy was 81.1% (95% CI, 76.9%-85.4%) when shown a clinical consultation with perfect accuracy ( ; eTable 5 in ).#### Figure 3. Baseline Diagnostic Accuracy Without AI Models and Percentage Point Differences in Accuracy Across Clinical Vignette Settings.]( in a new tab]( indicates diagnostic accuracy of heart failure, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) when shown clinical vignettes of patients with acute respiratory failure without AI model input; standard model, diagnostic accuracy when shown clinical vignettes and standard AI model diagnostic predictions about whether the patient has heart failure, pneumonia, and/or COPD; standard model plus explanations, diagnostic accuracy when shown standard AI predictions and an image-based AI explanation of the model’s reasoning for making a prediction within vignettes; systematically biased model, diagnostic accuracy when shown systematically biased AI predictions of low accuracy within vignettes; systematically biased model plus explanations, diagnostic accuracy when shown biased model predictions and explanations within vignettes; and clinical consultation, diagnostic accuracy when provided a short narrative describing the rational for the correct diagnosis within the vignette.Subgroup analysis included diagnostic accuracy specific to heart failure, pneumonia, and COPD; clinician profession, including 142 nurse practitioners or physician assistants, and 274 physicians; prior clinical decision–support interaction, including 132 participants who had prior experience interacting with clinical decision support systems and 286 who did not. Diagnostic accuracy and percentage point differences in accuracy were determined by calculating predictive margins and contrasts across vignette settings after fitting a cross-classified generalized random effects model of diagnostic accuracy.Systematically biased AI predictions without explanations decreased participant diagnostic accuracy to 61.7% (95% CI, 55.3%-68.2%), a decrease of 11.3 percentage points (95% CI, 7.2-15.5; _P_\\u2009<\\u2009.001) from the baseline score ( ; eTables 5 and 6 in ). This was mostly due to a decrease in participants’ diagnostic specificity (73% [95% CI, 71%-75%] to 53% [95% CI, 49%-58%]; eFigure 5 in ). When shown systematically biased AI with explanations, accuracy was 64.0% (95% CI, 57.6%-70.3%), a decrease of 9.1 percentage points (95% CI, 4.9-13.2; _P_ <.001) from the baseline score, which did not significantly differ from clinician diagnostic accuracy with biased AI without explanations (difference, 2.3 percentage points [95% CI, −2.7 to 7.2]; _P_\\u2009=\\u2009.37; eTables 5 and 7 in ), with little improvement to participants’ diagnostic specificity (53% [95% CI, 49%-58%] to 56% ). The direction of all effects was similar in all exploratory subgroup analyses ( ).### Secondary OutcomesCorrelations between participant responses and standard-model predictions and predictions with explanations were 0.53 (95% CI, 0.50-0.57) and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.56-0.62) respectively (eTable 8 in ). Correlations between participant responses and biased model predictions and predictions with explanations were 0.41 (95% CI, 0.38-0.45) and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.37-0.45), respectively.Treatment selection accuracy was 70.3% (95% CI, 65.5%-75.2%) without model predictions ( ; eTable 9 in ). When shown correct AI predictions, accuracy increased to 77.0% (95% CI, 72.6%-81.4%), an increase of 6.7 percentage points (95% CI, 4.1-9.3; ; eTables 9 and 10 in ). Accuracy was 80.4% (95% CI, 76.3%-84.5%) when shown correct AI predictions and explanations ( ; eTable 9 in ). When provided incorrect model predictions, participants treatment selection accuracy was 55.1% (95% CI, 48.8%-61.3%), a decrease of 15.3 percentage points (95% CI, 11.4-19.1) ( ; eTables 9 and 10 in ). When shown incorrect model predictions, providing explanations did not significantly increase participant accuracy ( ; eTable 11 in ).#### Figure 4.

Treatment selection accuracy and percentage point differences in accuracy were determined by calculating predictive margins and contrasts across vignette settings after fitting a cross-classified generalized random-effects model of treatment selection accuracy across settings.## DiscussionThis study examined how AI predictions and popular image-based AI model explanations could potentially help or worsen clinicians’ diagnostic and treatment decisions in patients with acute respiratory failure. The results showed that clinicians’ diagnostic accuracy improved when shown predictions from a standard AI model, but decreased when shown systematically biased AI predictions. Providing explanations did little to remedy the harmful effects of biased models on clinician accuracy. AI models trained on clinical data are prone to making biased predictions based on clinically irrelevant findings., ,  Left unchecked, models could exacerbate biases widespread in health care, and errors in clinical judgment influenced by AI could have severe consequences such as patient harm.Although the standard and systematically biased models shown in the vignettes had imperfect accuracy, their performance reflected what might be expected in real-world settings for models approved by regulators for difficult tasks like the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure. Even clinicians had only 81.1% diagnostic accuracy when provided perfectly accurate recommendations in the clinical consultation vignettes, which might reflect participant’s difficulty in recognizing perfectly accurate recommendations in these settings. This could also suggest that as AI models improve, there may be an upper bound on collaborative performance between AI models and clinicians for difficult diagnostic tasks.To measure whether explanations could mitigate errors made by systematically biased AI models, explanations were presented in a way that were considered to be obvious—the model relied completely on features unrelated to the clinical condition. Prior work outside of health care has shown that explanations can reduce overreliance on AI models when the task is cognitively difficult, but verifying the explanation is less costly in comparison. Although some have suggested that state-of-the-art explanations should lead to better user-AI interactions, participants in this study were unable to recognize overtly biased models with such explanations. This behavior aligns with work showing that users may still be deceived by incompetent AI models if they fail to understand the models’ simple explanations.Clinicians’ inability to leverage explanations when presented with systematically biased AI models may be due to several reasons. First, clinicians might have limited AI literacy. For example, 66.7% of participants were unaware that AI models could be systematically biased. Informing clinicians of the strengths and weaknesses of AI could make them more adept at leveraging model explanations. Second, clinicians were only shown a small number of the vignettes with explanations, and might need more training with image-based explanations. Third, common image-based AI model explanations, such as those tested in this study, are only approximations of model behavior., ,  They require users to form a mental model of what the explanation is communicating because the AI model cannot communicate in plain language what it is focusing on. It is possible that explanations may be more helpful when presented in a different way (eg, with text descriptions).### Study ImplicationsClinicians’ limited ability to recognize when AI models are systematically biased has important implications for medical AI regulatory policies. The FDA recently released guidance highlighting the importance of providing clinicians with the ability to independently verify clinical support software recommendations., ,  Explanations were also emphasized in the White House blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. Despite providing clinicians with tools with the ability to explain and that could aid them in identifying AI model mistakes, this study demonstrates that the ability to check an AI model’s reasoning using current image-based explanation approaches could fail to provide meaningful safeguards against systematically biased models.There are several potential paths forward to safely integrate AI in health care. First, additional training in limitations of AI systems could be incorporated into medical training, better equipping clinicians to identify biased models. Second, researchers developing explanation tools should involve clinicians to better understand their specific needs. Third, standardizing clinician-facing AI model information in simple language and empirically testing such standards may help clinicians understand appropriate model use and limitations. Finally, this study highlights the critical need for careful model validation, including appropriate subgroup testing, to identify and address biased behavior prior to deployment.### LimitationsThe current study has several limitations. First, it was conducted using a web-based survey interface, which is inherently different from the clinical setting. Second, although study recruitment resulted in a diverse participant population from 14 states, participants were slightly younger (34 years vs 41 years) and more female (53% vs 36%) than prior national statistics of hospitalists, and the design prevented collection of information on nonresponders. Third, the study focused on the effects of AI predictions and explanations among clinicians who make final diagnostic and treatment decisions. Although radiologists have more training in reading chest radiographs and may be more adept at understanding radiograph explanations, they were not included because they are not ultimately responsible for making these diagnostic and treatment decisions.## ConclusionsStandard AI models’ predictions and explanations improved diagnostic accuracy of clinicians, whereas systematically biased predictions and explanations reduced accuracy. Given the unprecedented pace of AI development, it is essential to carefully test AI integration into clinical workflows. Although the findings of the study suggest that clinicians may not be able to serve as a backstop against flawed AI, they can play an essential role in understanding AI’s limitations.Supplement 1.Trial Protocol (652.8KB, pdf)Supplement 2.Statistical Analysis Plan (295.6KB, pdf)Supplement 3.eMethods.**eFigure 1.** Survey instructions page**eFigure 2.** Clinical Vignette Layout**eFigure 3.** Participant Response Form for all nine vignettes**eFigure 4.** CONSORT Flow diagram of participants through the survey**eTable 1.** Characteristics of the patient population used in the vignettes**eTable 2.** Accuracy and AUROC of the standard model and systematically biased models across the full patient cohort (n=45)**eTable 3.** Count by geographical location of responses across the United States**eTable 4.** P-values for demographic differences between the AI model alone group versus the AI model + explanation group**eTable 5.** Cross-classified generalized random effects model estimates of participant accuracy (%) in diagnosing pneumonia, heart failure, and COPD**eTable 6.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ diagnostic accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of no model input, averaged across all three diagnoses**eTable 7.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ diagnostic accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of systematically biased model, averaged across all three diagnoses**eTable 8.** Pearson’s correlation between participant responses and model scores, with 1000 bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals**eTable 9.** Cross-classified generalized random effects model estimates of participant treatment decision accuracy (%) (align with clinical consult)**eTable 10.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ treatment accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of no model input, averaged across all three treatments**eTable 11.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ treatment accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of incorrect model input, averaged across all three treatments**eFigure 5.** Confusion matrices for the participant responses across vignette settings (2.1MB, pdf)Supplement 4.Data Sharing Statement (15.2KB, pdf)## References- 1.Tschandl P, Rinner C, Apalla Z, et al.

Patients underwent an AI medical interview, after which virtual care providers reviewed the interview summary and AI-provided differential diagnoses, communicated with patients, and finalized diagnoses and treatment plans. Our accuracy measures were agreement between AI diagnoses, virtual care providers, and blind adjudicators. We analyzed AI diagnostic agreement across different diagnoses, presenting symptoms, patient demographic characteristics such as race, and provider levels of experience. We also evaluated model performance improvement with retraining.### ResultsProviders selected an AI diagnosis in 84.2% (n = 85,976) of cases and the top-ranked AI diagnosis in 60.9% (n = 62,130) of cases. Agreement rates varied by diagnosis, with greater than or equal to 95% provider agreement with an AI diagnosis for 35 diagnoses (47% of cases, n = 47,679) and greater than or equal to 90% agreement for 57 diagnoses (69% of cases, n = 70,697). The average agreement rate for half of all presenting symptoms was greater than or equal to 90%. Adjusting for case mix, diagnostic accuracy exhibited minimal variation across demographic characteristics. The adjudicators’ consensus diagnosis, reached in 58.2% (n = 128) of adjudicated cases was always included in the AI differential diagnosis. Provider experience did not affect agreement, and model retraining increased diagnostic accuracy for retrained conditions from 96.6% to 98.0%.### ConclusionOur findings show that agreement between AI and provider diagnoses is high in most cases in the setting of this study. The results highlight the potential for AI to enhance primary care disease diagnosis and patient triage, with the capacity to improve over time.- Previousarticle in issue- Nextarticle in issue## Abbreviations and AcronymsAIartificial intelligenceEMRelectronic medical recordICD-10International Classification of Diseases, 10th RevisionRecommended articles© 2023 The Authors.

We thank all participants who contributed to the discussion and made it possible for us to provide feedback on this preprint.## Summary- Research question: The review ] aims to understand the development and applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care, assessing the prevalence and impact of AI methods in biomedical research. The focus is on the frequency and types of publications in 2023, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of the current AI landscape in health care and identify areas needing further research. It also aims to address the specialties in medicine with greater use of AI.- Research approach: The authors employed a mixed methods approach, combining classical bibliometric analysis and advanced deep learning techniques to analyze PubMed data. They established search criteria to collect papers published in 2023 related to AI and machine learning in health care, identifying subcategories and medical specialties within the dataset.- Research findings: An increase in AI-related health care publications was observed in 2023, with a total of 23,306 articles, which constitutes a 133.7% increase from the previous year. The analysis revealed a differential uptake of AI models across medical fields, with imaging being the most prevalent. The review also noted a spread across various specialties, with cardiology, gastroenterology, ophthalmology, and general clinics being prominent, while psychiatry had fewer publications.- Interesting aspects: The review provided insights into future AI trends in medicine and health care. The growth of image-based publications and the usefulness of AI in specific health care specialties were particularly noted. The review provides a valuable snapshot of AI’s role in health care research in 2023, highlighting the rapid growth and diverse applications of AI technologies across medical specialties. The authors found AI use in imaging was the most prevalent among the specialties and that other fields, such as gastroenterology, ophthalmology, and psychiatry are promising for future use of AI.- Relation to published literature: The authors attempt to establish their review as a foundational reference for the current state of AI in health care literature for the past year and to set the stage for future comparative analyses. However, prior work in reviewing the use of AI in certain medical fields, such as robotics and hospital administration, which are prevalent in the established literature, have not been thoroughly addressed in the paper and could warrant greater discussion.- Strengths and weaknesses: The review’s reproducibility and the use of mixed methods for bibliometric analysis are strengths of the paper. However, the concept of “mature” AI models could use improvement because of its vagueness, and the limited keyword search is a potential weakness. Suggestions for improvement include adhering to reporting guidelines like PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews), clarifying the definition of “mature” research, and considering the inclusion of “healthcare” in the initial search criteria. Additionally, the time frame of a single recent year is very short considering the fact that AI has been around since the 1956 Dartmouth conference and has long been used in the forefront of health research. The authors should consider suggesting that future studies with longer time frames may be carried out as the applications of AI progress over the years.Below we list major and minor concerns that were discussed by participants of the live review, and where possible, we provide suggestions on how to address those issues.## Major Concerns- The authors should more clearly articulate the generalizability to only within the PubMed corpus and, feasibly, within the search results of their query choice. Alternatively, the authors could consider expanding their search terms to include additional relevant keywords to be more holistic of the range of AI uses within health research or expand their database search outside of PubMed to ensure a broader inclusiveness of the literature.- The Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers (BERT)–based maturity classification model and other AI classification methods encountered difficulties in correctly categorizing publications into their medical specialties. This challenge stemmed from BERT’s vocabulary limitations, as it was only trained on a specific set of tokens, making it struggle with unfamiliar or uncommon terms not present in its training data. The observed accuracy of these models ranged from 30% to 68%, suggesting frequent misclassifications or inaccurate categorizations of publication specialties. The authors should consider further improvements and training of AI models to enhance the accuracy of specialty classification and reduce the occurrence of false positives.- The adoption of multimodal models incorporating diverse data types remains restricted, with image data largely prevailing in AI applications within health care, despite the vast array of available data. The authors should consider implementing multimodal models that combine different data formats such as text, tabular, and voice, as this could significantly enhance the effectiveness and adaptability of AI in health care.- Authors should consider how their study deviates from the “gold standard” PRISMA framework and guidelines and discuss why their method would be preferred over PRISMA in this specific case.- The figures need considerable revision before this would be acceptable for publication. Reviewers recommend the following changes:- For Figure 4B, authors should include a definition of terms to make it clear what exactly AI, machine learning, large language model, natural language processing, etc, refers to in context of the papers scoped.- To improve readability, the authors should organize the visualizations under subheaders. For example, Figures 3 and 5 showing visualizations across health care specialties can be grouped together under one subheader.- For Figure 3, imaging should be analyzed separately as it is a major outlier. For example, breaking it down into the specialties in which imaging was applied, as imaging cuts across all specialties (eg, radiology, oncology, histology)- Data and code should be made freely accessible by default and not incumbent on the reader to “request the data” from the authors. The authors should remedy this oversight before submitting for publication.## Minor Concerns- The authors should more carefully define “maturity.” Typically, in AI, maturity refers to a property of how well established the use of AI is within an organization. It is not clear from the paper how that generalizes to a medical field per se.- The paper should lavish more details on the geographic subanalysis and results.- The authors should provide more details on the justification of why they chose the specific search terms used to define the sampling frame. If possible, the authors should point to an empirical determination of why those specific terms were chosen over other reasonably good choices.- Authors should consider providing more details about the papers scoped, for example, distribution across journals/frequency of journals and most common author-provided keywords.- The authors should explain the term “infodemic” as used in the introduction perhaps by referencing the World Health Organization definition.- Authors should provide support for their claims on the “exponential growth of AI,” for example, by referencing past studies or including visualizations to illustrate this.## Concluding RemarksThe reviewers agree that this paper makes an important and timely contribution to the literature. There are several issues that should be addressed prior to finalization of the manuscript—however, the reviewers believe these concerns are easily addressable by the authors.## AcknowledgmentsPREreview and JMIR Publications thank the authors of the preprint for posting their work openly for feedback.

Two UK universities trained the software on a dataset of 800 brain scans of stroke patients and then trialled it on 2,000 patients.The results were impressive. Alongside the AI model\\'s accuracy, the software was also able to identify the timescale within which the stroke happened - crucial information for professionals.As Dr Paul Bentley, consultant neurologist, told the _Health Tech Newspaper_: “For the majority of strokes caused by a blood clot, if a patient is within 4.5 hours of the stroke happening, he or she is eligible for both medical and surgical treatments. Up to 6 hours, the patient is also eligible for surgical treatment, but after this time point, deciding whether these treatments might be beneficial becomes tricky, as more cases become irreversible. So it’s essential for doctors to know both the initial onset time, as well as whether a stroke could be reversed.”## AI can spot more bone fractures than humans canSurprisingly, urgent care doctors miss broken bones in up to 10% of cases. What’s more, X-ray technicians are both in short supply and overloaded.So using  could potentially avoid both unnecessary X-rays and missed fractures.

It’s down to paramedics to decide who does or doesn’t need to go, and always with an awareness of how few beds are available.A study in Yorkshire in the north of England found that in 80% of cases . The AI model was trained on factors such as a patient’s mobility, pulse and blood oxygen levels and chest pain – it also proved to respond without bias. NICE did caution, however, that before being put into more widespread use, more training was needed.## Detecting early signs of more than 1,000 diseasesA new AI machine learning model can  before the patient is even aware of any symptoms, according to its maker AstraZeneca.Using medical data from 500,000 people who are part of a UK health data repository, the machine could “predict with high confidence a disease diagnosis many years later”.Slavé Petrovski, who led the research, told Sky News: \"For many of these diseases, by the time they manifest clinically and the individual goes to the doctor because of an ailment or visible observation, that is far down the line from when the disease process began.“We can pick up signatures in an individual that are highly predictive of developing , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney disease and many others,\" he said.Another UK study has found that an AI tool can successfully detect .

The new brief stresses the importance of safeguarding  in the process.“AI must not become a new frontier for exploitation,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Systems. “We must ensure that Indigenous Peoples and local communities are not only protected but are active partners in shaping the future of AI in traditional medicine.”##### Have you read?- ##### - ##### - ##### ## AI for healthcare adminAdministrative tasks are both inevitable and time-consuming in the medical field.

Al-antar, who served as the Guest Editor (GE) of this Special Issue, provides an introduction to the Special Issue, outlining the scope of, the significance of, and the emerging trends in the integration of AI and ML in diagnostics. It sets the stage for the subsequent articles by emphasizing the transformative potential of these technologies in healthcare ].Following this, Gil-Rios et al. ] introduce a new method for automatically classifying coronary stenosis using a feature selection technique. Their proposed method achieved a 99% discrimination rate using only four features, suggesting that this method could be useful in a clinical decision support system.Ogunpola et al. ] tackle the global health issue of cardiovascular diseases by focusing on improving early detection, particularly of myocardial infarction, using machine learning. Their study addresses the problem of imbalanced datasets, which can bias predictions, and employs seven classifiers: K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network, Gradient Boost, XGBoost, and Random Forest. The optimized XGBoost model achieved an outstanding performance with an accuracy of 98.50%, a precision of 99.14%, 98.29% recall, and an F1 score of 98.71%, significantly enhancing diagnostic accuracy for heart disease.Lee et al. ] evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of two AI techniques, namely KARA-CXR and ChatGPT, in chest X-ray reading. Using 2000 chest X-ray images, their study assessed accuracy, false findings, location inaccuracies, count inaccuracies, and hallucinations. They found that KARA-CXR significantly outperformed ChatGPT regarding diagnostic accuracy (70.50% vs. 40.50%, according to one observer), false findings, and non-hallucination rate (75% vs. 38%). Both systems showed moderate inter-observer agreement. Their study highlights the superior performance of KARA-CXR in medical imaging diagnostics compared to ChatGPT.Marquez et al. ] focused on using machine learning to differentiate between positive and negative influenza patients in Mexico, where influenza has been a persistent issue since 2009. They used a dataset of 15,480 records from 2010 to 2020, containing clinical and demographic data of patients tested with RT-qPCR. This study evaluated various classification methods and found that Random Forest and Bagging classifiers perform best in terms of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, F1 score, and the AUC. These methods show promise for aiding clinical diagnosis in settings where molecular tests are impractical.Ali et al. ] investigated detecting Parkinson’s disease (PD) using voice attributes from both PD patients and healthy individuals. They employed filter feature selection to remove quasi-constant features and tested several classification models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models, on two datasets. Remarkable results were achieved on Dataset 1, with the Decision Tree and Random Forest methods achieving impressive accuracy. Ensemble learning methods (voting, stacking, and bagging) were applied to further enhance the results, and genetic selection was also tested for accuracy and precision. Their study found higher precision in predicting PD patients and better overall performance when using Dataset 1 compared to Dataset 2.Zakareya et al. ] propose a new deep learning model for breast cancer classification, incorporating features like granular computing and attention mechanisms to achieve enhanced accuracy and reduce the workload of doctors. Their model’s effectiveness is demonstrated by its superior performance compared to other models on two case studies, achieving 93% and 95% accuracy on ultrasound and histopathology images, respectively.Al-rimy et al. ] examined the use of DenseNet169 for knee osteoarthritis detection using X-ray images. An adaptive early-stopping technique with gradual cross-entropy loss estimation is proposed to improve the model’s performance. This approach prevents overfitting and optimizes the number of training epochs. The proposed model demonstrates superior accuracy, precision, recall, and loss compared to existing solutions, indicating the effectiveness of adaptive early stopping and GCE for accurately detecting knee OA.Fatih Uysal ] developed a hybrid artificial intelligence system to detect monkeypox in skin images. An open-source, multi-class image dataset was used, addressing data imbalance through augmentation and preprocessing. State-of-the-art deep learning models were employed for detection, and a unique hybrid model combining high-performing models with LSTM was created. The resulting system achieved 87% test accuracy and a 0.8222 Cohen’s kappa score.Al-Haidari et al. ] propose a new deep learning framework for MR image reconstruction based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) and U-Net. A hybrid spatial and k-space loss function is introduced to improve image quality by minimizing the L1 distance in both spatial and frequency domains. The proposed framework outperformed the traditional SENSE technique and individual U-Net/CGAN models in terms of the PSNR, while maintaining a comparable SSIM. Their CGAN-based framework also showed the best reconstruction performance, proving useful for practical cardiac image reconstruction by providing an enhanced image quality.Bhakar et al. ] reviewed recent computational intelligence-based approaches for identifying disease severity levels. Their study focuses on Parkinson’s disease and diabetic retinopathy, but also briefly covers other diseases. This review examines the methodology, dataset used, and disease type of each approach, evaluating performance metrics such as accuracy and specificity. It also presents public repositories for further research in this field.Alnashwan et al. ] conducted a systematic review to examine the latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and computational intelligence for the detection and treatment of stuttering. They analyzed 14 journal articles from 2019 onward to investigate how AI can accurately determine and classify manifestations of stuttering, as well as how computational intelligence can contribute to developing innovative assessment tools and intervention strategies. Their review highlights the potential of AI and computational intelligence to revolutionize the assessment and treatment of stuttering, enabling personalized and effective approaches for improving the lives of people who have a stutter.## 3. LimitationsAlthough the articles published in this Special Issue present valuable contributions to the field of medical diagnostics leveraging AI and machine learning (ML) techniques, some limitations can be identified across these articles:- (1)Many of these studies have specific focuses or use case scenarios, potentially limiting the generalizability of their findings to broader contexts or populations;- (2)Some articles may have methodological limitations, such as biases in data collection, imbalanced datasets, or reliance on specific classifiers, which could affect the reliability and applicability of their results;- (3)While many studies report impressive results in performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, the evaluation criteria and datasets used may not fully reflect real-world clinical scenarios, leading to potential overestimations of performance;- (4)The interpretation of results may vary across the studies, being potentially influenced by the researchers’ perspectives or biases, which could impact the conclusions drawn from the data.## 4. Future DirectionsMedical image diagnosis powered by artificial intelligence (AI) represents the cutting edge of improvements in healthcare. We should continually strive to enhance the health and wellbeing of our community by providing smart solutions that benefit both patients and physicians. AI technology has significantly advanced medical image diagnosis, improving accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility in healthcare scenarios. AI algorithms can analyze X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, and patient records, such as those of patients with coronary stenosis or Parkinson’s disease, to detect abnormalities such as tumors, fractures, and infections. For example, AI can identify early-stage cancers that might be missed by the human eye. AI can interpret echocardiograms (ECGs) and cardiac MRI scans to detect heart conditions like arrhythmias, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. In light of this, this Special Issue highlights and disseminates the latest breakthroughs in AI-driven diagnostic technologies, with the aim of showcasing innovative research, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and exploring the transformative impact of AI on medical imaging and diagnosis. By bringing together contributions from leading experts, we hope to advance this field of research, improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, and ultimately enhance patient care and health outcomes.The recent rise of large language models (LLMs) like Gemini and medGemini , ] or ChatGPT and BiomedGPT ] presents a transformative opportunity for the healthcare industry, particularly in the realm of diagnosis. These powerful tools can significantly enhance existing diagnostic systems by providing more insightful explanations, ultimately leading to more accurate and efficient patient care. One key contribution of LLMs lies in their ability to generate detailed textual reports. By analyzing vast amounts of medical data, including patient history, test results, and relevant research, LLMs can produce comprehensive reports that not only outline a diagnosis but also explain the reasoning behind it. This detailed explanation assists healthcare professionals by offering a transparent and step-by-step breakdown of how the LLM arrived at its conclusions, fostering trust in the system and allowing doctors to leverage the LLM’s insights while incorporating their own medical expertise. While LLMs cannot directly generate heat maps (i.e., saliency maps) for medical images, they can play a significant role in the process. When integrated with computer vision models, LLMs are able to analyze medical images (X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, etc.), and they can be trained to detect and extract relevant features, anomalies, and patterns from these images. Through this, LLMs have the ability to generate textual descriptions of these highlighted areas that explain why they are important for a certain diagnosis. This provides a form of visual explanation alongside the LLM’s textual report. The combined power of detailed textual explanations and visual heat maps can empower healthcare professionals in several ways:- (1)It improves diagnostic accuracy by offering a comprehensive understanding of the LLM’s reasoning;- (2)It facilitates communication with patients by providing clear and accessible explanations of the diagnostic process , ];- (3)It fosters collaboration between humans and machines, allowing medical professionals to leverage the strengths of LLMs while retaining their own irreplaceable role in healthcare decision making ].However, it is crucial to acknowledge that LLMs are still under development, and their integration into healthcare systems requires careful consideration. Ensuring data privacy and security is paramount, and ongoing human oversight remains essential. In conclusion, LLM-based tools like Gemini and GPTs (Generative Pre-Trained Transformers) hold immense potential to revolutionize healthcare diagnostics. As mentioned above, the detailed textual explanations and visual heat maps provided by these tools can empower healthcare professionals by allowing them gain a deeper understanding of the diagnostic process, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency in patient care. As LLM technology continues to evolve, the future of healthcare diagnosis promises to be one of increased transparency, collaboration, and, ultimately, improved patient outcomes. The development of robust medical XAI models is often hindered by the limited availability of labeled datasets, particularly for rare diseases or specific imaging modalities. Generative AI techniques ] offer promising solutions to address this challenge, enabling the creation of synthetic medical data across various modalities—text, images, signals, etc. LLMs like GPT-3 excel at generating synthetic patient records that closely mimic the structure, terminology, and statistical distributions of real clinical notes. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have revolutionized medical image synthesis, producing realistic X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans that can incorporate specific anatomical variations or pathologies. This not only increases the size of datasets but allows researchers to simulate diverse disease presentations. Additionally, GANs can augment datasets by introducing realistic variations to existing images or even by translating images between modalities (e.g., generating a potential CT scan from an MRI scan), reducing the reliance on acquiring data in multiple ways. Generative models are able to synthesize physiological signals like ECGs, EEGs, and others, replicating real-world patterns and anomalies. This can be leveraged to expand training data for diagnostic models and facilitate the development of monitoring devices. Furthermore, generative AI can create hybrid signals with controlled variations, simulating complex or unusual health conditions to diversify training data.Finally, we can potentially leverage contrastive learning ] to address the challenge of data-labeling exhaustion in the development of LLM-based tools similar to medGemini or BiomedGPT. Contrastive learning is a technique within self-supervised learning where a machine learning model learns by creating its own supervisory signals from unlabeled data. The primary goal of this is to train a model to recognize similarities and differences between data samples: the model learns an embedding space (a kind of representational map) where similar items are clustered together and dissimilar items are far apart. Meanwhile, deep active learning could prove to be capable of supporting and automating the process of labeling medical data.## 5. ConclusionsIn conclusion, this Special Issue underscores the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in medical diagnostics, as evidenced by the collection of cutting-edge research it presents. While these advancements offer unprecedented accuracy and efficiency in disease detection and treatment planning across various medical fields, including radiology, pathology, genomics, and personalized medicine, several limitations persist. These limitations include the potential lack of generalizability, methodological constraints, and the need for the careful interpretation of results. Looking ahead, the integration of large language models (LLMs) like Gemini and medGemini holds promise for further revolutionizing healthcare diagnosis through empowering healthcare professionals with detailed textual explanations and visual heat maps to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis. Despite these advancements, however, ongoing considerations for data privacy, security, and human oversight are essential. Ultimately, the future of healthcare diagnosis promises increased transparency, collaboration, and improved patient outcomes as AI technology continues to evolve and move forward to address current challenges.## AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) for providing support by means of a wide range of research grants from the Korean government (MSIT) (No. RS-2022-00166402 and RS-2023-00256517) for improving AI-based medical diagnostics.

And yet, \"AI digital health solutions hold the potential to enhance efficiency, reduce costs and improve health outcomes globally,\" says the white paper. Here are seven examples of AI technologies already making a difference in the medical field.AI and healthcare2018201920202021202220232024Year010864212Billions $A Flourish chart]( AI can interpret brain scansA new AI software is \" \" as professionals at examining the brain scans of stroke patients. Two UK universities trained the software on a dataset of 800 brain scans of stroke patients and then trialled it on 2,000 patients.The results were impressive. Alongside the AI model\\\\\\'s accuracy, the software was also able to identify the timescale within which the stroke happened - crucial information for professionals.As Dr Paul Bentley, consultant neurologist, told the _Health Tech Newspaper_: “For the majority of strokes caused by a blood clot, if a patient is within 4.5 hours of the stroke happening, he or she is eligible for both medical and surgical treatments. Up to 6 hours, the patient is also eligible for surgical treatment, but after this time point, deciding whether these treatments might be beneficial becomes tricky, as more cases become irreversible. So it’s essential for doctors to know both the initial onset time, as well as whether a stroke could be reversed.”## AI can spot more bone fractures than humans canSurprisingly, urgent care doctors miss broken bones in up to 10% of cases. What’s more, X-ray technicians are both in short supply and overloaded.So using  could potentially avoid both unnecessary X-rays and missed fractures. The UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says the technology is safe, reliable and could reduce the need for follow-up appointments.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesBut there are concerns around the fast rollout of AI in healthcare.\"It is important that people using these tools are properly trained in doing so, meaning they  from technological limitations ... such as the possibility for wrong information being given,\" Dr Caroline Green of the Institute for Ethics in AI at the University of Oxford told the BBC.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum creating guardrails for Artificial Intelligence?Show moreIn response to the uncertainties surrounding generative AI and the need for robust AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes for all, the Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) has launched the .The Alliance unites industry leaders, governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations to champion responsible global design and release of transparent and inclusive AI systems.This includes the workstreams part of the , in collaboration with the Centre for Energy and Materials, the Centre for Advanced Manufacturing and Supply Chains, the Centre for Cybersecurity, the Centre for Nature and Climate, and the Global Industries team.## Assessing ambulance needs with AIIn the UK, around  are taken by ambulance to hospital each month. It’s down to paramedics to decide who does or doesn’t need to go, and always with an awareness of how few beds are available.A study in Yorkshire in the north of England found that in 80% of cases . The AI model was trained on factors such as a patient’s mobility, pulse and blood oxygen levels and chest pain – it also proved to respond without bias. NICE did caution, however, that before being put into more widespread use, more training was needed.## Detecting early signs of more than 1,000 diseasesA new AI machine learning model can  before the patient is even aware of any symptoms, according to its maker AstraZeneca.Using medical data from 500,000 people who are part of a UK health data repository, the machine could “predict with high confidence a disease diagnosis many years later”.Slavé Petrovski, who led the research, told Sky News: \"For many of these diseases, by the time they manifest clinically and the individual goes to the doctor because of an ailment or visible observation, that is far down the line from when the disease process began.“We can pick up signatures in an individual that are highly predictive of developing , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney disease and many others,\" he said.Another UK study has found that an AI tool can successfully detect .

But ChatRWD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system – which essentially combines LLMs with retrieval systems to improve output – produced useful answers to  (compared with 2%-10% for the LLMs).Digital interfaces are increasingly being rolled out to help triage patients, too. In an , part of the World Economic Forum’s , a case study on digital patient platform Huma, revealed it could reduce readmission rates by 30%, time spent reviewing patients by up to 40% and “alleviated the workload of healthcare providers”.The report anticipates a future in which technologies like these could “dramatically transform the patient experience. People who are generally healthy can use self-monitoring devices to optimize their mental and physical health, while those with health issues will have access to a wide range of digital solutions”.## AI and traditional medicinePracticed in 170 countries and used by billions of people, traditional medicine has maintained its relevance in the modern world in part because of its emphasis on a holistic approach to healthcare. And while . A new brief from the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, \\\\\\'Mapping the application of artificial intelligence in traditional medicine\\\\\\', shows how  (TCIM) while protecting cultural heritage.India is the first country to launch a , utilizing AI tools to catalogue and analyze indigenous medical texts. The country is also exploring how AI and Ayurgenomics - a field which combines the ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda with modern genomics - can intersect, to see what herbal formulations could help tackle modern diseases.Similarly, , while in South Korea, AI is being used to analyze traditional medicine compounds to treat blood disorders.The global TCIM market is expected to reach nearly $600 billion in 2025 - and AI looks set to accelerate that market further and faster. The new brief stresses the importance of safeguarding  in the process.“AI must not become a new frontier for exploitation,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Systems. “We must ensure that Indigenous Peoples and local communities are not only protected but are active partners in shaping the future of AI in traditional medicine.”##### Have you read?- ##### - ##### - ##### ## AI for healthcare adminAdministrative tasks are both inevitable and time-consuming in the medical field. Using AI co-pilots could free up clinicians to focus more of their time on patients.Microsoft has recently announced its , an AI healthcare tool that can listen to, and create notes on, clinical consultations. And  already has a suite of AI models specifically tailored to alleviate some of the administrative burdens in healthcare. In Germany, an AI platform called  has cut testing and diagnosis times from weeks to hours and its founders are determined to show that the technology \"can be an ally, not an obstacle\". Co-founder Dr Sebastian Casu told EU-Startups: \"No one joins the healthcare sector to spend hours on admin\".Of course, having an AI tool listening in and taking notes on your doctor\\\\\\'s appointment will not appeal to everyone. A recent study in the UK found that just  (although over two-thirds are comfortable with the technology being used to free up professionals\\\\\\' time). Then there is the question of accuracy. A report last year found that OpenAI\\\\\\'s Whisper, used by many hospitals to summarize patient meetings, was .This is why regulation of AI tools is so vital. In the UK, AI-powered medical devices are strictly regulated by the .). In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last year  and concluded that, while the FDA will “continue to play a central role in ensuring safe, effective, and trustworthy AI tools” it was also essential that “all involved entities … attend to AI with the rigour this transformative technology merits”.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookies##### Don\\\\\\'t miss any update on this topicCreate a free account and access your personalized content collection with our latest publications and analyses.License and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.##### Share:!## Forum StoriesnewsletterBringing you weekly curated insights and analysis on the global issues that matter.### More onHealth and Healthcare Systems      Camila Pintarelli and Thomas OxleyOctober 9, 2025Bushra AlBlooshi, Hoda Al Khzaimi and Heba AhmadOctober 8, 2025Hoda Al Khzaimi, Bushra AlBlooshi and Heba AhmadOctober 7, 2025Joan-Paula Bor and Kathleen SchmelerOctober 6, 2025Naoko TochibayashiOctober 3, 2025Oct 2, 2025EN   Remove menu\\'}, {\\'title\\': \\'Improving Patient Care and Safety With AI - Healthcare Executive\\', \\'url\\': \\'https://www.healthcareexecutive.org/archives/march-april-2024/improving-patient-care--and-safety-with-ai\\', \\'markdown\\': \\'By Topic: TechnologyInformation ManagementSafety QualityBy Collection: Safety![]( intelligence has demonstrated that it can improve patient care and safety by helping clinicians analyze imaging and pathology reports.\\\\xa0Many applications, though, are still in the early stages of development and adoption, especially in the automation of administrative tasks.“For quality care, I believe AI allows us to augment clinical decision-making,” says Sachin Shah, MD, an associate professor of medicine and pediatrics and chief medical information officer at UChicago Medicine in Chicago. He notes there is a sizable predictive analytics and machine learning space that can significantly leverage the large amount of data available. As a result, “we can better identify patterns, predict health issues and customize treatment plans,” Shah says.Achieving that level of precision and personalization at the patient level will help improve outcomes and streamline many care-delivery processes, according to Shah.Patient safety is also enhanced by AI’s capacity to analyze vast volumes of data in real time. “This can lead to early detection of clinical deterioration, intervention ahead of potential adverse drug reactions and an overall reduction of medical errors,” Shah says. “Clinicians are alerted sooner that something may be trending in the wrong direction, well before it may become clinically evident.”### AI’s PotentialRichard Greenhill, DHA, CPHQ, FACHE, director of the undergraduate healthcare management program in the School of Health Professions at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, says high-quality healthcare depends on reliable and accurate processes in the delivery of patient care “to ensure that safety is prioritized for sustainable outcomes. Process variation is the enemy of quality, so the tools of AI are exciting because they can undertake some of the more routine and repeatable processes that are susceptible to the impact of human factors.”The TTUHSC Institute of Telehealth and Digital Innovation was established in September 2023 to create a digital health ecosystem, where technologies such as AI transform care delivery in West Texas. “AI has the potential to unleash new ways of approaching performance improvement and patient safety as we begin to tap into the universe of data that encompasses health—both inside and outside of the delivery system,” says Greenhill.Systems thinking is also an important component of quality care. “Systems thinking in care delivery helps us focus on interrelationships in processes to solve complex problems in our quality improvement strategy,” Greenhill explains. “This is why we should not ever first blame people when a medical mistake or undesired event occurs. A system produces the results for which it was designed. Thus, a person or a tool, such as AI in our delivery system, can never itself be the focus when an error occurs.”Healthcare facilities must look deeply at the design\\\\xa0of how these resources were planned for and supported in their activities, according to Greenhill. AI allows\\\\xa0“us to look across interprofessional processes and aggregate datasets to discover insights that we may not\\\\xa0have assumed.” Examples include early detection via analysis of diagnostic studies, such as radiology and clinical lab, and more quickly identifying high-risk patients based on treatment and disease progression. “AI can assist quality professionals, clinicians and\\\\xa0leaders to make sense of the complexities in our systems in managing risks associated with handoffs,\\\\xa0care coordination and treatment interventions,” Greenhill says.AI can enhance patient care in everything from ophthalmology to cardiology and pathology/oncology to psychiatry, according to Thomas Fuchs, DrSc, dean of the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine in New York City. “AI should help physicians to be faster and more effective, do new things they currently cannot do and reduce burnout,” he says.Even before the AI department was established in the fall of 2021, Mount Sinai was testing AI systems in the ICU to alert nurses to patient risk of malnutrition, deterioration or fall, along with reducing false alarms and staff overhead. The AI system takes information from the EHR and various devices in the ICU.Cancer detection. AI has also benefited pathology at Mount Sinai by detecting cancer and grading cancer earlier than before. The institution has developed an AI foundation model based on 3 billion images from 400,000 digital microscopy slides of cancer biopsies and resections. “The model can detect biomarkers to predict what cancer treatment will work for a specific patient,” Fuchs says.Diagnostic imaging assisted by AI holds promise, as well. A retrospective study published online in European Radiology in March 2023 concluded that among more than 1,200 breast cancer cases in Norway, an AI system scored 93% of the screen-detected cancers and 40% of the interval cancers with an AI score of 10 (on a scale of 1 to 10, based on the risk of malignancy). Furthermore, the AI system scored all screen-detected cancers and nearly 50% of interval cancers in women with the highest breast density with an AI score of 10. This resulted in a sensitivity of 80.9% for women with the highest breast density for the AI system, compared to 62.8% for independent double reading by radiologists.Roughly 40% of the screen-detected cancers achieved an AI score of 10 on the prior mammograms, indicating a potential for earlier detection by using AI in screen-reading.Physicians at the Breast Center at Mount Sinai Medical Center believe that the use of AI for detecting new abnormalities in mammograms and MRI scans is promising. They also predict that AI will help radiologists interpret mammograms while reducing the number of false positive interpretations, thus avoiding unnecessary biopsies. However, further research is needed to ensure the technology’s reliability and the anticipated benefits.Informatics. Excitement about the potential for AI led the University of Kentucky to form a multidisciplinary collaborative of physicians, data scientists, biomedical engineers and others to form the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Alliance. After two years of success in starting projects around radiology, pharmacy and cancer, the alliance merged in 2022 with an innovations program to form the Center for Applied AI within biomedical informatics for even broader AI applications across healthcare and the university. Most AI healthcare initiatives at the university hospital stem from a desire to improve quality of care and reporting, such as better implementing the recommendation from the Society of Thoracic Surgery that a patient take a beta-blocker within 24 hours of surgery. Using tools already developed or in development in one discipline allows center members to more quickly apply solutions to other projects.A chatbot is being developed at the college that will connect with patients preparing to undergo cardiac surgery. The chatbot would help guide patients on when to take their medicine and help answer questions they may have about the surgery.Over the past year, there has been a rapid increase in the optimization of administrative tasks completed via AI, including documentation, prior authorizations and revenue cycling. “We are also able to better communicate with our patients and give our patients more self-efficacy,” Shah of UChicago Medicine says. “Conversational AI is very well suited to replace many of the burdensome nonclinical tasks that do not require clinical judgement.AI offers an opportunity to enhance quality care by augmenting clinical decision-making, according to Shah. “Through predictive analytics and machine learning, we can leverage vast amounts of data to identify patterns, predict potential health issues and customize treatment plans for individual patients. This personalization can significantly improve outcomes and streamline care delivery processes.”Similarly, AI’s role in patient safety “lies in its ability to analyze data in real time, allowing for early detection of potential risks such as adverse drug interactions or deteriorating patient condition,” Shah says. AI-powered systems can also assist in proactive interventions, thus reducing medical errors and ensuring timely and accurate care, all of which ultimately safeguard patient well-being.UChicago Medicine is scheduled to begin a pilot study this spring comprising 250 of its physicians to leverage generative AI to streamline and take over much of the clinical documentation.Some EHR providers include AI algorithms in their products, according to Greenhill. “These tools show promise to augment and enhance work for clinicians,” he says. “However, as these tools become more widely used, we need to maintain vigilance about the risk that they pose to patients and processes due to model and data bias.”AI chatbots—automated software applications—can perform many mundane tasks and reduce the burden on staff, physicians and nurses so they can pursue “the meaningful work they signed up to do, such as physicians spending more time with patients,” Greenhill says.“If a human does the same task 10 times every hour,\\\\xa0he or she is more likely to make a mistake due to a\\\\xa0host of human factors,” Greenhill says. By contrast,\\\\xa0AI chatbots can operate nonstop, requiring neither breaks nor rest. “This is a win in the war on process variation,” he says.Surgical care. Danielle Walsh, MD, FAAP, FACS, a professor of surgery and vice chair of Surgery for Quality and Process Improvement at the University\\\\xa0of Kentucky College of Medicine in Lexington, was part of a panel of surgeons who discussed the impact\\\\xa0of AI on surgical practices at the American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress 2023 in October. By allowing AI to take over many of the repetitive and rote administrative tasks that burden physicians, “the physician can perform more cognitive decision-making and focus more on human connections and time spent with patients,” says Walsh.AI will also play a major role in mandatory reporting of quality metrics to governmental and other entities, according to Walsh, freeing up even more staff members to perform more substantial work to truly improve quality of care. A study published online in JAMA Network in June 2023 on resources spent on just measuring and reporting data on 162 unique quality metrics found that an estimated 108,478 person-hours with a personnel cost of $5 million and another $603,000 in vendor fees were required. “Those funds are better spent on interventions than reporting,” Walsh says.AI tools also can communicate with a patient at home to ensure drug adherence, collect feedback on how patients are feeling, and use that feedback to become more connected with the patient in between visits or after discharge from the hospital. “And if you add in digital sensors, we can do tremendous monitoring at home,” Walsh says. “During COVID, people at home were at ICU-level care.”A patient with a blood vessel bypassed in the leg, for example, could wear a sock with a sensor at home to detect if blood flow begins to decrease before the blood vessel blocks off again and before the patient develops a blue, painful foot. “AI combined with sensors will allow us to intervene earlier and prevent more serious complications,” Walsh says.### Looking ForwardAs for AI cost, some healthcare facilities already have 5G network capability, along with modern wiring and systems that are compatible with AI, while others will need to invest in infrastructure improvements. “There will also be tradeoffs,” Walsh says. “Because AI requires a tremendous amount of computing power, you are not going to be able to run every AI algorithm simultaneously. And as the area grows, you will need to prioritize AI systems that meet the needs of a specific institution and the specific patient population being served.”Which areas of AI to pursue differ by organization and their culture, according to Shah, and are determined by staffing and the ability of teams and leadership to adjust. “There is not necessarily a lot of replacement of human expertise coming, but certainly a lot of reallocating human resources to different work that is ideally more top-of-license work, by automating some of the repetitive administrative tasks and algorithmic work,” he says.However, the quality of the output from AI is contingent on the quality of data entered, “so you need to invest a lot into your data infrastructure,” Shah says. “The quality of your data needs to be high.”There are also ethical considerations. “There has to be clear transparency around the decision-making in these models,” Shah says. “The concept of algorithmic bias is really important to understand and to ensure we are minimizing. Humans need to be at the center to carefully scrutinize any potential bias by closely monitoring the inputs, the algorithms and outputs to ensure they are not leading to unintended consequences.”_Bob Kronemyer is a freelance writer based in Elkhart, Ind._### Acceptance and Implementation StrategiesDanielle Walsh, MD, FAAP, FACS, a professor of surgery and vice chair of Surgery for Quality and Process Improvement at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine in Lexington, believes there are two big myths about using AI in healthcare: that physicians don’t want AI and that patients don’t want AI.****\\'}]', name='web_search_tool', call_id='call_VMsXcnyqQcMvApHu6L6AaZb3', is_error=False), FunctionExecutionResult(content='[{\\'title\\': \\'AI in Healthcare Statistics: Market Insights & Growth - Binariks\\', \\'url\\': \\'https://binariks.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-ai-healthcare-market/\\', \\'markdown\\': \\'- ![]( ![]( ![]( AI in Healthcare Statistics: Market Insights & GrowthUpdated Jun 26, 2025 · 9 min readHealthcareData Science and AI/MLAI DevelopmentContent      !Artificial Intelligence has a great demand in the healthcare industry.

However, accuracy significantly decreased by 11.3% when clinicians were shown systematically biased AI model predictions and model explanations did not mitigate the negative effects of such predictions.### MeaningAI model explanations did not help clinicians recognize systematically biased AI models.## Abstract### ImportanceArtificial intelligence (AI) could support clinicians when diagnosing hospitalized patients; however, systematic bias in AI models could worsen clinician diagnostic accuracy. Recent regulatory guidance has called for AI models to include explanations to mitigate errors made by models, but the effectiveness of this strategy has not been established.### ObjectivesTo evaluate the impact of systematically biased AI on clinician diagnostic accuracy and to determine if image-based AI model explanations can mitigate model errors.### Design, Setting, and ParticipantsRandomized clinical vignette survey study administered between April 2022 and January 2023 across 13 US states involving hospitalist physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants.### InterventionsClinicians were shown 9 clinical vignettes of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory failure, including their presenting symptoms, physical examination, laboratory results, and chest radiographs. Clinicians were then asked to determine the likelihood of pneumonia, heart failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as the underlying cause(s) of each patient’s acute respiratory failure. To establish baseline diagnostic accuracy, clinicians were shown 2 vignettes without AI model input. Clinicians were then randomized to see 6 vignettes with AI model input with or without AI model explanations. Among these 6 vignettes, 3 vignettes included standard-model predictions, and 3 vignettes included systematically biased model predictions.### Main Outcomes and MeasuresClinician diagnostic accuracy for pneumonia, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.### ResultsMedian participant age was 34 years (IQR, 31-39) and 241 (57.7%) were female. Four hundred fifty-seven clinicians were randomized and completed at least 1 vignette, with 231 randomized to AI model predictions without explanations, and 226 randomized to AI model predictions with explanations. Clinicians’ baseline diagnostic accuracy was 73.0% (95% CI, 68.3% to 77.8%) for the 3 diagnoses. When shown a standard AI model without explanations, clinician accuracy increased over baseline by 2.9 percentage points (95% CI, 0.5 to 5.2) and by 4.4 percentage points (95% CI, 2.0 to 6.9) when clinicians were also shown AI model explanations. Systematically biased AI model predictions decreased clinician accuracy by 11.3 percentage points (95% CI, 7.2 to 15.5) compared with baseline and providing biased AI model predictions with explanations decreased clinician accuracy by 9.1 percentage points (95% CI, 4.9 to 13.2) compared with baseline, representing a nonsignificant improvement of 2.3 percentage points (95% CI, −2.7 to 7.2) compared with the systematically biased AI model.### Conclusions and RelevanceAlthough standard AI models improve diagnostic accuracy, systematically biased AI models reduced diagnostic accuracy, and commonly used image-based AI model explanations did not mitigate this harmful effect.### Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: * * *This randomized clinical vignette study examines whether providing AI explanations to biased AI models enhances clinician diagnostic accuracy.## IntroductionArtificial intelligence (AI) shows promise in identifying abnormalities in clinical images, such as pneumonia from chest radiographs, diabetic retinopathy from fundus images, or skin cancer from histopathology images., , ,  AI models in clinical care analyze patient data, identify patterns, and make predictions. Integrating AI into clinical decision-making may result in higher accuracy than a clinician without AI. However, systematically biased AI models (ie, models that consistently misdiagnose patient subpopulations) can lead to errors and potential harm., ,  For example, an AI model trained on data in which female patients are consistently underdiagnosed for heart disease may learn this bias and underdiagnose females if deployed. Physician performance can be harmed by following incorrect predictions, a phenomenon known as _overreliance_. Ideally, clinicians would be able to follow AI predictions when correct but ignore incorrect AI predictions. However, the extent to which AI can be safely integrated to support diagnostic decisions is still largely unknown.Recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance highlights the importance of providing clinicians with the ability to independently review the basis for software recommendations, including the information and logic used in a model’s decisions. Although AI developers frequently use AI explanations to debug models during development, providing similar explanations to clinicians, as recommended by the FDA, could potentially enhance interpretability after deployment. Explanations could help clinicians better understand a model’s logic before acting on its recommendation, helping to mitigate errors made by systematically biased models. For example, image-based explanations designed to highlight important regions of an image that were used in an AI model’s decision could help clinicians identify when models are behaving inaccurately.To determine if providing AI explanations could enhance clinician diagnostic accuracy and alleviate the negative impact of systematically biased models, we conducted a randomized clinical vignette web-based survey study. We focused on the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure as a test case for this broader challenge because acute respiratory failure is commonly encountered in practice, often misdiagnosed, and evaluated using commonly encountered data such as chest radiographs that AI tools can analyze. We presented participants with standard and systematically biased AI, randomizing participants to see AI predictions alone or AI predictions with explanations. This design allowed us to test our hypothesis that systematically biased models would harm clinician diagnostic accuracy, but commonly used image-based explanations would help clinicians partially recover their performance.## Methods### ParticipantsWe recruited hospitalist physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants who commonly care for patients with acute respiratory failure to complete the study. The study protocol is available in  and the statistical analysis plan in . We first identified 12 hospitalist leaders as site champions through interaction with the Society of Hospital Medicine research committee and the authors’ personal contacts. Site champions advertised the study via email to their local hospital medicine divisions. Each site champion sent a follow-up reminder email after 2 weeks. Interested participants were directed to the study landing page, which confirmed study eligibility, provided additional study information, study instructions, and obtained informed consent prior to randomization (see the study protocol in  and eFigure 1 in ). Participants were offered a $50 gift card for completing the study.This study was deemed exempt by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. Although the study was not registered initially given its vignette-based design, to ensure it was appropriately reflected in the trial literature, it was registered on ClinicialTrials.gov after its completion with the registration parameters based on the prespecified protocol.### Clinical VignettesWe created 45 clinical vignettes based on patients hospitalized with acute respiratory failure in 2017 at the University of Michigan. Patients were selected to achieve study goals while being representative of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory failure (see eMethods in ). A study team member reviewed each patient’s chart to create a succinct version of the patient’s presenting history, past medical history, current medications, physical examination findings, laboratory findings, and chest radiograph for each vignette (eFigure 2 in ). At least 4 pulmonary physicians independently reviewed each patient’s complete medical record to determine if pneumonia, heart failure, and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was the patient’s underlying diagnosis.Each vignette had 3 reference diagnostic labels pertaining to pneumonia, heart failure, and COPD based on the average of these reviews, and each reference label was binary, indicating whether the disease was present or absent. See eTable 1 in  for patient characteristics for additional details.### Study DesignThe survey was conducted using a Qualtrics survey tool. Participants were assigned 9 of 45 clinical vignettes to review. All participants followed the same vignette order: 2 vignettes without AI predictions, 6 vignettes with AI predictions, and 1 vignette with a clinical consultation by a hypothetical colleague ( ). Upon study initiation, all participants were randomized to AI predictions with or without AI explanations for all 6 AI vignettes, and all participants were also randomized to see 1 of 3 types of systematically biased AI models during 3 of the 6 AI vignettes.#### Figure 1. Randomization and Study Flow Diagram for the 9 Clinical Vignettes.]( in a new tab]( completing informed consent, participants were randomized to artificial intelligence (AI) predictions with or without explanations and all participants were also randomized to 1 of 3 types of systematically biased AI models during a subset of vignettes in the study. The 3 systematically biased AI models included a model predicting pneumonia if aged 80 years or older, a model predicting heart failure if body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 30 or higher, and a model predicting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) if a blur was applied to the radiograph. Participants were first shown 2 vignettes without AI predictions to measure baseline diagnostic accuracy. The next 6 vignettes included AI predictions. If the participant was randomized to see AI explanations, the participant was also shown an AI model explanation with the AI predictions. Three vignettes had standard AI predictions, and 3 had biased AI predictions shown in random order. The final vignette included a clinical consultation, a short narrative provided by a hypothetical trusted colleague who identified the correct diagnosis and their diagnostic rationale.The first 2 vignettes did not include AI predictions and were used to measure baseline diagnostic accuracy. The next 6 vignettes included AI predictions immediately after the patient case. If randomized to see AI explanations, the participant was also shown an image-based AI model explanation alongside the AI predictions. Three vignettes had standard AI predictions and 3 had biased predictions shown in random order. The final vignette included a clinical consultation, a short narrative provided by a hypothetical trusted colleague describing the rationale behind the most likely diagnosis and recommended treatments. By design, the clinical consultation vignette always recommended the correct diagnosis and treatment, serving as a realistic upper bound of participant diagnostic accuracy when provided accurate recommendations.After each vignette, participants were asked to separately assess how likely pneumonia, heart failure, or COPD was contributing to the patient’s respiratory failure on a scale of 0 to 100 (eFigure 3 in ). Responses were collected on a continuous scale to calculate the correlation between AI model scores and participant responses. In calculating accuracy, responses of 50 or higher were considered positive for the diagnosis. Patients could have 1, more than 1, or none of the conditions. After completing the diagnostic assessment, participants were asked whether they would administer any combination of steroids, antibiotics, intravenous (IV) diuretics, or none of these treatments to the patient.### Standard and Systematically Biased AI Model Predictions and ExplanationsWhen participants were shown AI predictions, the model provided a score for each diagnosis on a scale of 0 to 100 estimating how likely the patient’s symptoms were due to pneumonia, heart failure, and COPD ( ). Standard AI predictions were generated using a machine learning model trained using standard approaches on a separate data set. All participants were randomized to see 1 of 3 systematically biased AI models: (1) a model predicting a high likelihood of pneumonia for a patient who was 80 years or older; (2) a model predicting a high likelihood of heart failure if a patient’s body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 30 or higher; and (3) a model predicting a high likelihood of COPD if a blur was applied to the radiograph (eMethods in ). Vignettes with biased models were shown for patients with attributes leading the biased model to predict the diagnosis with high likelihood. For example, a participant randomized to see the model biased for age was shown vignettes of patients 80 years or older with the biased model, and the model displayed a high likelihood prediction for pneumonia and standard predictions for the 2 other diagnoses.#### Figure 2. Examples of Model Predictions and Explanations for Standard and Systematically Biased AI Models for Patients.!Patient 1 is an 81-year-old male with respiratory failure from heart failure. A, The standard AI model correctly diagnosed heart failure as the cause of acute respiratory failure and provided an explanation highlighting areas in the chest radiograph used to make the prediction. B, The systematically biased AI model incorrectly diagnosed pneumonia as the cause of acute respiratory failure due to the patient’s age and provided an explanation highlighting irrelevant features in the chest radiograph. Standard-model predictions for heart failure (the correct diagnosis) are also provided.Patient 2 is an 88-year-old female with respiratory failure from COPD. C, The standard AI model incorrectly diagnosed pneumonia and correctly diagnosed COPD as the cause of respiratory failure and provided reasonable explanations. D, The biased AI model incorrectly diagnosed pneumonia as the cause of respiratory failure due to patient age and provided an explanation highlighting irrelevant features in the chest radiograph. Standard-model predictions for COPD (the correct diagnosis) are also provided.For participants randomized to explanations, explanations were presented when the AI model provided a score of 50 or higher (corresponding to positive diagnosis). Explanations were shown as Grad-CAM heatmaps overlaid on the chest radiograph that highlighted which regions of the image most affecting the model’s prediction ( ). Explanations generated from the standard model highlighted clinically meaningful regions on the chest radiograph (eg, lungs). Explanations associated with the systematically biased models highlighted areas of the radiograph corresponding to age, BMI, or preprocessing (eg, low bone density, soft tissue; ; and see eMethods in  3 for details of how biased model explanations were generated). Because the biased models always made positive predictions, participants randomized to explanations were always shown explanations with biased predictions. In contrast, when shown standard-model predictions, explanations were shown with 17 pneumonia predictions (38%) , 18 heart failure predictions (40%), and 9 COPD predictions (20%).By design, the standard model had an overall accuracy of 75% and the biased models had overall accuracy of 70% (eTable 2 in ), which is on par with physicians and reflects the difficulty of the diagnostic tasks. Therefore, such models would likely meet specifications by regulators for approval. However, among the subset of patients for whom the biased models made biased predictions, the biased models were 33% accurate, whereas the standard model was 67% accurate.### Participant DemographicsAfter completing the vignettes, participant demographic information, including self-reported gender, race, and ethnicity, was collected to assess sample diversity and representativeness. Participants were also asked about AI knowledge (see eMethods for the postsurvey questions in ).### Study OutcomesThe primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy between vignette settings, defined as the number of correct diagnostic assessments over the total number of assessments. Participants made 3 separate assessments in each vignette, 1 for each diagnosis. If the participant’s assessment agreed with the reference label, the diagnostic assessment was correct. Overall accuracy was calculated using assessments for all diagnoses. Accuracy for a specific diagnosis was calculated using assessments relevant to the specific diagnosis.In vignettes with biased model predictions, the biased model provided a prediction for the diagnosis for which it was biased and standard predictions for the 2 other diagnoses. Although participants made 3 diagnostic assessments in those vignettes, only diagnostic assessments corresponding to the biased predictions were included in the accuracy calculation.Secondary outcomes included treatment selection accuracy, correlation between participants’ diagnostic assessment scores and model scores, and confusion matrices across vignette settings.### Statistical AnalysisThe primary preplanned analysis compared diagnostic accuracy between the clinician baseline and each AI model vignette setting. This analysis sought to specifically determine (1) whether standard AI improved clinician accuracy, (2) whether standard AI with explanations improved accuracy, (3) whether biased AI hurt diagnostic accuracy, and (4) whether biased AI with explanations helped clinicians recover from the biased predictions.Completed vignettes were included in the analysis regardless of whether a participant completed all 9 vignettes. Diagnostic accuracy across vignette settings was compared by fitting a cross-classified, generalized, random-effects model, in which individual diagnostic assessments were nested within study participants and patients. The outcome was a binary variable indicating whether the diagnostic assessment was correct and the exposure was the specific vignette setting for which the assessment was performed. Predictive margins and contrasts were calculated to estimate accuracy at each vignette setting, and differences between settings, with 95% CIs were calculated using the delta method.Exploratory subgroup analyses were also conducted by specific diagnosis, clinician profession, and participant’s prior interactions with clinical decision support. A secondary analysis was conducted to understand the effect of correct and incorrect model predictions on treatment selection accuracy.We aimed to recruit 400 participants based on simulation-based power calculations. The simulation ensured adequate power to detect a 20% decrease in accuracy with the systematically biased AI model compared with baseline and 10% improvement with AI explanations (eMethods in  3 and the statistical analysis plan in ). Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 16 (StataCorp). Statistical significance was based on a _P_ value <.05. _P_ values for multiple comparisons were not adjusted in the preplanned analyses.## ResultsOf 1024 participants who viewed the study information page, 572 (56%) initiated the study and were randomized ( ; eFigure 4 in ). Four hundred fifty-seven participants completed at least 1 vignette and were included in the primary analysis, including 226 randomized to AI model and explanations. Four hundred eighteen participants completed all 9 vignettes. Study participants were from 13 US states (eTable 3 in ). Participant demographics did not meaningfully differ across randomization groups (eTable 4 in ). The majority (97.6%) of participants’ general practice area was hospital medicine. The median age was 34 years (IQR, 31-39); 241 participants (57.7%) were female; and 19.1% of participants self-reported as Asian, 1.7% as Black, and 68.1% as White. Of all the participants, 31.6% of had previously interacted with clinical decision support tools and 66.7% were unaware that AI could be systematically biased based on patient demographics.### Table.

Baseline Diagnostic Accuracy Without AI Models and Percentage Point Differences in Accuracy Across Clinical Vignette Settings.]( in a new tab]( indicates diagnostic accuracy of heart failure, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) when shown clinical vignettes of patients with acute respiratory failure without AI model input; standard model, diagnostic accuracy when shown clinical vignettes and standard AI model diagnostic predictions about whether the patient has heart failure, pneumonia, and/or COPD; standard model plus explanations, diagnostic accuracy when shown standard AI predictions and an image-based AI explanation of the model’s reasoning for making a prediction within vignettes; systematically biased model, diagnostic accuracy when shown systematically biased AI predictions of low accuracy within vignettes; systematically biased model plus explanations, diagnostic accuracy when shown biased model predictions and explanations within vignettes; and clinical consultation, diagnostic accuracy when provided a short narrative describing the rational for the correct diagnosis within the vignette.Subgroup analysis included diagnostic accuracy specific to heart failure, pneumonia, and COPD; clinician profession, including 142 nurse practitioners or physician assistants, and 274 physicians; prior clinical decision–support interaction, including 132 participants who had prior experience interacting with clinical decision support systems and 286 who did not. Diagnostic accuracy and percentage point differences in accuracy were determined by calculating predictive margins and contrasts across vignette settings after fitting a cross-classified generalized random effects model of diagnostic accuracy.Systematically biased AI predictions without explanations decreased participant diagnostic accuracy to 61.7% (95% CI, 55.3%-68.2%), a decrease of 11.3 percentage points (95% CI, 7.2-15.5; _P_\\\\u2009<\\\\u2009.001) from the baseline score ( ; eTables 5 and 6 in ). This was mostly due to a decrease in participants’ diagnostic specificity (73% [95% CI, 71%-75%] to 53% [95% CI, 49%-58%]; eFigure 5 in ). When shown systematically biased AI with explanations, accuracy was 64.0% (95% CI, 57.6%-70.3%), a decrease of 9.1 percentage points (95% CI, 4.9-13.2; _P_ <.001) from the baseline score, which did not significantly differ from clinician diagnostic accuracy with biased AI without explanations (difference, 2.3 percentage points [95% CI, −2.7 to 7.2]; _P_\\\\u2009=\\\\u2009.37; eTables 5 and 7 in ), with little improvement to participants’ diagnostic specificity (53% [95% CI, 49%-58%] to 56% ). The direction of all effects was similar in all exploratory subgroup analyses ( ).### Secondary OutcomesCorrelations between participant responses and standard-model predictions and predictions with explanations were 0.53 (95% CI, 0.50-0.57) and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.56-0.62) respectively (eTable 8 in ). Correlations between participant responses and biased model predictions and predictions with explanations were 0.41 (95% CI, 0.38-0.45) and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.37-0.45), respectively.Treatment selection accuracy was 70.3% (95% CI, 65.5%-75.2%) without model predictions ( ; eTable 9 in ). When shown correct AI predictions, accuracy increased to 77.0% (95% CI, 72.6%-81.4%), an increase of 6.7 percentage points (95% CI, 4.1-9.3; ; eTables 9 and 10 in ). Accuracy was 80.4% (95% CI, 76.3%-84.5%) when shown correct AI predictions and explanations ( ; eTable 9 in ). When provided incorrect model predictions, participants treatment selection accuracy was 55.1% (95% CI, 48.8%-61.3%), a decrease of 15.3 percentage points (95% CI, 11.4-19.1) ( ; eTables 9 and 10 in ). When shown incorrect model predictions, providing explanations did not significantly increase participant accuracy ( ; eTable 11 in ).#### Figure 4.

Treatment selection accuracy and percentage point differences in accuracy were determined by calculating predictive margins and contrasts across vignette settings after fitting a cross-classified generalized random-effects model of treatment selection accuracy across settings.## DiscussionThis study examined how AI predictions and popular image-based AI model explanations could potentially help or worsen clinicians’ diagnostic and treatment decisions in patients with acute respiratory failure. The results showed that clinicians’ diagnostic accuracy improved when shown predictions from a standard AI model, but decreased when shown systematically biased AI predictions. Providing explanations did little to remedy the harmful effects of biased models on clinician accuracy. AI models trained on clinical data are prone to making biased predictions based on clinically irrelevant findings., ,  Left unchecked, models could exacerbate biases widespread in health care, and errors in clinical judgment influenced by AI could have severe consequences such as patient harm.Although the standard and systematically biased models shown in the vignettes had imperfect accuracy, their performance reflected what might be expected in real-world settings for models approved by regulators for difficult tasks like the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure. Even clinicians had only 81.1% diagnostic accuracy when provided perfectly accurate recommendations in the clinical consultation vignettes, which might reflect participant’s difficulty in recognizing perfectly accurate recommendations in these settings. This could also suggest that as AI models improve, there may be an upper bound on collaborative performance between AI models and clinicians for difficult diagnostic tasks.To measure whether explanations could mitigate errors made by systematically biased AI models, explanations were presented in a way that were considered to be obvious—the model relied completely on features unrelated to the clinical condition. Prior work outside of health care has shown that explanations can reduce overreliance on AI models when the task is cognitively difficult, but verifying the explanation is less costly in comparison. Although some have suggested that state-of-the-art explanations should lead to better user-AI interactions, participants in this study were unable to recognize overtly biased models with such explanations. This behavior aligns with work showing that users may still be deceived by incompetent AI models if they fail to understand the models’ simple explanations.Clinicians’ inability to leverage explanations when presented with systematically biased AI models may be due to several reasons. First, clinicians might have limited AI literacy. For example, 66.7% of participants were unaware that AI models could be systematically biased. Informing clinicians of the strengths and weaknesses of AI could make them more adept at leveraging model explanations. Second, clinicians were only shown a small number of the vignettes with explanations, and might need more training with image-based explanations. Third, common image-based AI model explanations, such as those tested in this study, are only approximations of model behavior., ,  They require users to form a mental model of what the explanation is communicating because the AI model cannot communicate in plain language what it is focusing on. It is possible that explanations may be more helpful when presented in a different way (eg, with text descriptions).### Study ImplicationsClinicians’ limited ability to recognize when AI models are systematically biased has important implications for medical AI regulatory policies. The FDA recently released guidance highlighting the importance of providing clinicians with the ability to independently verify clinical support software recommendations., ,  Explanations were also emphasized in the White House blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. Despite providing clinicians with tools with the ability to explain and that could aid them in identifying AI model mistakes, this study demonstrates that the ability to check an AI model’s reasoning using current image-based explanation approaches could fail to provide meaningful safeguards against systematically biased models.There are several potential paths forward to safely integrate AI in health care. First, additional training in limitations of AI systems could be incorporated into medical training, better equipping clinicians to identify biased models. Second, researchers developing explanation tools should involve clinicians to better understand their specific needs. Third, standardizing clinician-facing AI model information in simple language and empirically testing such standards may help clinicians understand appropriate model use and limitations. Finally, this study highlights the critical need for careful model validation, including appropriate subgroup testing, to identify and address biased behavior prior to deployment.### LimitationsThe current study has several limitations. First, it was conducted using a web-based survey interface, which is inherently different from the clinical setting. Second, although study recruitment resulted in a diverse participant population from 14 states, participants were slightly younger (34 years vs 41 years) and more female (53% vs 36%) than prior national statistics of hospitalists, and the design prevented collection of information on nonresponders. Third, the study focused on the effects of AI predictions and explanations among clinicians who make final diagnostic and treatment decisions. Although radiologists have more training in reading chest radiographs and may be more adept at understanding radiograph explanations, they were not included because they are not ultimately responsible for making these diagnostic and treatment decisions.## ConclusionsStandard AI models’ predictions and explanations improved diagnostic accuracy of clinicians, whereas systematically biased predictions and explanations reduced accuracy. Given the unprecedented pace of AI development, it is essential to carefully test AI integration into clinical workflows. Although the findings of the study suggest that clinicians may not be able to serve as a backstop against flawed AI, they can play an essential role in understanding AI’s limitations.Supplement 1.Trial Protocol (652.8KB, pdf)Supplement 2.Statistical Analysis Plan (295.6KB, pdf)Supplement 3.eMethods.**eFigure 1.** Survey instructions page**eFigure 2.** Clinical Vignette Layout**eFigure 3.** Participant Response Form for all nine vignettes**eFigure 4.** CONSORT Flow diagram of participants through the survey**eTable 1.** Characteristics of the patient population used in the vignettes**eTable 2.** Accuracy and AUROC of the standard model and systematically biased models across the full patient cohort (n=45)**eTable 3.** Count by geographical location of responses across the United States**eTable 4.** P-values for demographic differences between the AI model alone group versus the AI model + explanation group**eTable 5.** Cross-classified generalized random effects model estimates of participant accuracy (%) in diagnosing pneumonia, heart failure, and COPD**eTable 6.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ diagnostic accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of no model input, averaged across all three diagnoses**eTable 7.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ diagnostic accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of systematically biased model, averaged across all three diagnoses**eTable 8.** Pearson’s correlation between participant responses and model scores, with 1000 bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals**eTable 9.** Cross-classified generalized random effects model estimates of participant treatment decision accuracy (%) (align with clinical consult)**eTable 10.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ treatment accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of no model input, averaged across all three treatments**eTable 11.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ treatment accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of incorrect model input, averaged across all three treatments**eFigure 5.** Confusion matrices for the participant responses across vignette settings (2.1MB, pdf)Supplement 4.Data Sharing Statement (15.2KB, pdf)## References- 1.Tschandl P, Rinner C, Apalla Z, et al.

Patients underwent an AI medical interview, after which virtual care providers reviewed the interview summary and AI-provided differential diagnoses, communicated with patients, and finalized diagnoses and treatment plans. Our accuracy measures were agreement between AI diagnoses, virtual care providers, and blind adjudicators. We analyzed AI diagnostic agreement across different diagnoses, presenting symptoms, patient demographic characteristics such as race, and provider levels of experience. We also evaluated model performance improvement with retraining.### ResultsProviders selected an AI diagnosis in 84.2% (n = 85,976) of cases and the top-ranked AI diagnosis in 60.9% (n = 62,130) of cases. Agreement rates varied by diagnosis, with greater than or equal to 95% provider agreement with an AI diagnosis for 35 diagnoses (47% of cases, n = 47,679) and greater than or equal to 90% agreement for 57 diagnoses (69% of cases, n = 70,697). The average agreement rate for half of all presenting symptoms was greater than or equal to 90%. Adjusting for case mix, diagnostic accuracy exhibited minimal variation across demographic characteristics. The adjudicators’ consensus diagnosis, reached in 58.2% (n = 128) of adjudicated cases was always included in the AI differential diagnosis. Provider experience did not affect agreement, and model retraining increased diagnostic accuracy for retrained conditions from 96.6% to 98.0%.### ConclusionOur findings show that agreement between AI and provider diagnoses is high in most cases in the setting of this study. The results highlight the potential for AI to enhance primary care disease diagnosis and patient triage, with the capacity to improve over time.- Previousarticle in issue- Nextarticle in issue## Abbreviations and AcronymsAIartificial intelligenceEMRelectronic medical recordICD-10International Classification of Diseases, 10th RevisionRecommended articles© 2023 The Authors.

Rachel Grasfield, Ranjani Harish, Kolapo Oyebola, Arya Rahgozar, Renato Sabbatini, Nour Shaballout, and Trevor van Mierlo wished to be recognized for their participation in the live review discussion, even though they have not contributed to authoring the review below. We thank all participants who contributed to the discussion and made it possible for us to provide feedback on this preprint.## Summary- Research question: The review ] aims to understand the development and applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care, assessing the prevalence and impact of AI methods in biomedical research. The focus is on the frequency and types of publications in 2023, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of the current AI landscape in health care and identify areas needing further research. It also aims to address the specialties in medicine with greater use of AI.- Research approach: The authors employed a mixed methods approach, combining classical bibliometric analysis and advanced deep learning techniques to analyze PubMed data. They established search criteria to collect papers published in 2023 related to AI and machine learning in health care, identifying subcategories and medical specialties within the dataset.- Research findings: An increase in AI-related health care publications was observed in 2023, with a total of 23,306 articles, which constitutes a 133.7% increase from the previous year. The analysis revealed a differential uptake of AI models across medical fields, with imaging being the most prevalent. The review also noted a spread across various specialties, with cardiology, gastroenterology, ophthalmology, and general clinics being prominent, while psychiatry had fewer publications.- Interesting aspects: The review provided insights into future AI trends in medicine and health care. The growth of image-based publications and the usefulness of AI in specific health care specialties were particularly noted. The review provides a valuable snapshot of AI’s role in health care research in 2023, highlighting the rapid growth and diverse applications of AI technologies across medical specialties. The authors found AI use in imaging was the most prevalent among the specialties and that other fields, such as gastroenterology, ophthalmology, and psychiatry are promising for future use of AI.- Relation to published literature: The authors attempt to establish their review as a foundational reference for the current state of AI in health care literature for the past year and to set the stage for future comparative analyses. However, prior work in reviewing the use of AI in certain medical fields, such as robotics and hospital administration, which are prevalent in the established literature, have not been thoroughly addressed in the paper and could warrant greater discussion.- Strengths and weaknesses: The review’s reproducibility and the use of mixed methods for bibliometric analysis are strengths of the paper. However, the concept of “mature” AI models could use improvement because of its vagueness, and the limited keyword search is a potential weakness. Suggestions for improvement include adhering to reporting guidelines like PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews), clarifying the definition of “mature” research, and considering the inclusion of “healthcare” in the initial search criteria. Additionally, the time frame of a single recent year is very short considering the fact that AI has been around since the 1956 Dartmouth conference and has long been used in the forefront of health research. The authors should consider suggesting that future studies with longer time frames may be carried out as the applications of AI progress over the years.Below we list major and minor concerns that were discussed by participants of the live review, and where possible, we provide suggestions on how to address those issues.## Major Concerns- The authors should more clearly articulate the generalizability to only within the PubMed corpus and, feasibly, within the search results of their query choice. Alternatively, the authors could consider expanding their search terms to include additional relevant keywords to be more holistic of the range of AI uses within health research or expand their database search outside of PubMed to ensure a broader inclusiveness of the literature.- The Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers (BERT)–based maturity classification model and other AI classification methods encountered difficulties in correctly categorizing publications into their medical specialties. This challenge stemmed from BERT’s vocabulary limitations, as it was only trained on a specific set of tokens, making it struggle with unfamiliar or uncommon terms not present in its training data. The observed accuracy of these models ranged from 30% to 68%, suggesting frequent misclassifications or inaccurate categorizations of publication specialties. The authors should consider further improvements and training of AI models to enhance the accuracy of specialty classification and reduce the occurrence of false positives.- The adoption of multimodal models incorporating diverse data types remains restricted, with image data largely prevailing in AI applications within health care, despite the vast array of available data. The authors should consider implementing multimodal models that combine different data formats such as text, tabular, and voice, as this could significantly enhance the effectiveness and adaptability of AI in health care.- Authors should consider how their study deviates from the “gold standard” PRISMA framework and guidelines and discuss why their method would be preferred over PRISMA in this specific case.- The figures need considerable revision before this would be acceptable for publication. Reviewers recommend the following changes:- For Figure 4B, authors should include a definition of terms to make it clear what exactly AI, machine learning, large language model, natural language processing, etc, refers to in context of the papers scoped.- To improve readability, the authors should organize the visualizations under subheaders. For example, Figures 3 and 5 showing visualizations across health care specialties can be grouped together under one subheader.- For Figure 3, imaging should be analyzed separately as it is a major outlier. For example, breaking it down into the specialties in which imaging was applied, as imaging cuts across all specialties (eg, radiology, oncology, histology)- Data and code should be made freely accessible by default and not incumbent on the reader to “request the data” from the authors. The authors should remedy this oversight before submitting for publication.## Minor Concerns- The authors should more carefully define “maturity.” Typically, in AI, maturity refers to a property of how well established the use of AI is within an organization. It is not clear from the paper how that generalizes to a medical field per se.- The paper should lavish more details on the geographic subanalysis and results.- The authors should provide more details on the justification of why they chose the specific search terms used to define the sampling frame. If possible, the authors should point to an empirical determination of why those specific terms were chosen over other reasonably good choices.- Authors should consider providing more details about the papers scoped, for example, distribution across journals/frequency of journals and most common author-provided keywords.- The authors should explain the term “infodemic” as used in the introduction perhaps by referencing the World Health Organization definition.- Authors should provide support for their claims on the “exponential growth of AI,” for example, by referencing past studies or including visualizations to illustrate this.## Concluding RemarksThe reviewers agree that this paper makes an important and timely contribution to the literature. There are several issues that should be addressed prior to finalization of the manuscript—however, the reviewers believe these concerns are easily addressable by the authors.## AcknowledgmentsPREreview and JMIR Publications thank the authors of the preprint for posting their work openly for feedback.

Two UK universities trained the software on a dataset of 800 brain scans of stroke patients and then trialled it on 2,000 patients.The results were impressive. Alongside the AI model\\\\\\'s accuracy, the software was also able to identify the timescale within which the stroke happened - crucial information for professionals.As Dr Paul Bentley, consultant neurologist, told the _Health Tech Newspaper_: “For the majority of strokes caused by a blood clot, if a patient is within 4.5 hours of the stroke happening, he or she is eligible for both medical and surgical treatments. Up to 6 hours, the patient is also eligible for surgical treatment, but after this time point, deciding whether these treatments might be beneficial becomes tricky, as more cases become irreversible. So it’s essential for doctors to know both the initial onset time, as well as whether a stroke could be reversed.”## AI can spot more bone fractures than humans canSurprisingly, urgent care doctors miss broken bones in up to 10% of cases. What’s more, X-ray technicians are both in short supply and overloaded.So using  could potentially avoid both unnecessary X-rays and missed fractures.

It’s down to paramedics to decide who does or doesn’t need to go, and always with an awareness of how few beds are available.A study in Yorkshire in the north of England found that in 80% of cases . The AI model was trained on factors such as a patient’s mobility, pulse and blood oxygen levels and chest pain – it also proved to respond without bias. NICE did caution, however, that before being put into more widespread use, more training was needed.## Detecting early signs of more than 1,000 diseasesA new AI machine learning model can  before the patient is even aware of any symptoms, according to its maker AstraZeneca.Using medical data from 500,000 people who are part of a UK health data repository, the machine could “predict with high confidence a disease diagnosis many years later”.Slavé Petrovski, who led the research, told Sky News: \"For many of these diseases, by the time they manifest clinically and the individual goes to the doctor because of an ailment or visible observation, that is far down the line from when the disease process began.“We can pick up signatures in an individual that are highly predictive of developing , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney disease and many others,\" he said.Another UK study has found that an AI tool can successfully detect .

People who are generally healthy can use self-monitoring devices to optimize their mental and physical health, while those with health issues will have access to a wide range of digital solutions”.## AI and traditional medicinePracticed in 170 countries and used by billions of people, traditional medicine has maintained its relevance in the modern world in part because of its emphasis on a holistic approach to healthcare.

The new brief stresses the importance of safeguarding  in the process.“AI must not become a new frontier for exploitation,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Systems. “We must ensure that Indigenous Peoples and local communities are not only protected but are active partners in shaping the future of AI in traditional medicine.”##### Have you read?- ##### - ##### - ##### ## AI for healthcare adminAdministrative tasks are both inevitable and time-consuming in the medical field.

Al-antar, who served as the Guest Editor (GE) of this Special Issue, provides an introduction to the Special Issue, outlining the scope of, the significance of, and the emerging trends in the integration of AI and ML in diagnostics. It sets the stage for the subsequent articles by emphasizing the transformative potential of these technologies in healthcare ].Following this, Gil-Rios et al. ] introduce a new method for automatically classifying coronary stenosis using a feature selection technique. Their proposed method achieved a 99% discrimination rate using only four features, suggesting that this method could be useful in a clinical decision support system.Ogunpola et al. ] tackle the global health issue of cardiovascular diseases by focusing on improving early detection, particularly of myocardial infarction, using machine learning. Their study addresses the problem of imbalanced datasets, which can bias predictions, and employs seven classifiers: K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network, Gradient Boost, XGBoost, and Random Forest. The optimized XGBoost model achieved an outstanding performance with an accuracy of 98.50%, a precision of 99.14%, 98.29% recall, and an F1 score of 98.71%, significantly enhancing diagnostic accuracy for heart disease.Lee et al. ] evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of two AI techniques, namely KARA-CXR and ChatGPT, in chest X-ray reading. Using 2000 chest X-ray images, their study assessed accuracy, false findings, location inaccuracies, count inaccuracies, and hallucinations. They found that KARA-CXR significantly outperformed ChatGPT regarding diagnostic accuracy (70.50% vs. 40.50%, according to one observer), false findings, and non-hallucination rate (75% vs. 38%). Both systems showed moderate inter-observer agreement. Their study highlights the superior performance of KARA-CXR in medical imaging diagnostics compared to ChatGPT.Marquez et al. ] focused on using machine learning to differentiate between positive and negative influenza patients in Mexico, where influenza has been a persistent issue since 2009. They used a dataset of 15,480 records from 2010 to 2020, containing clinical and demographic data of patients tested with RT-qPCR. This study evaluated various classification methods and found that Random Forest and Bagging classifiers perform best in terms of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, F1 score, and the AUC. These methods show promise for aiding clinical diagnosis in settings where molecular tests are impractical.Ali et al. ] investigated detecting Parkinson’s disease (PD) using voice attributes from both PD patients and healthy individuals. They employed filter feature selection to remove quasi-constant features and tested several classification models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models, on two datasets. Remarkable results were achieved on Dataset 1, with the Decision Tree and Random Forest methods achieving impressive accuracy. Ensemble learning methods (voting, stacking, and bagging) were applied to further enhance the results, and genetic selection was also tested for accuracy and precision. Their study found higher precision in predicting PD patients and better overall performance when using Dataset 1 compared to Dataset 2.Zakareya et al. ] propose a new deep learning model for breast cancer classification, incorporating features like granular computing and attention mechanisms to achieve enhanced accuracy and reduce the workload of doctors. Their model’s effectiveness is demonstrated by its superior performance compared to other models on two case studies, achieving 93% and 95% accuracy on ultrasound and histopathology images, respectively.Al-rimy et al. ] examined the use of DenseNet169 for knee osteoarthritis detection using X-ray images. An adaptive early-stopping technique with gradual cross-entropy loss estimation is proposed to improve the model’s performance. This approach prevents overfitting and optimizes the number of training epochs. The proposed model demonstrates superior accuracy, precision, recall, and loss compared to existing solutions, indicating the effectiveness of adaptive early stopping and GCE for accurately detecting knee OA.Fatih Uysal ] developed a hybrid artificial intelligence system to detect monkeypox in skin images. An open-source, multi-class image dataset was used, addressing data imbalance through augmentation and preprocessing. State-of-the-art deep learning models were employed for detection, and a unique hybrid model combining high-performing models with LSTM was created. The resulting system achieved 87% test accuracy and a 0.8222 Cohen’s kappa score.Al-Haidari et al. ] propose a new deep learning framework for MR image reconstruction based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) and U-Net. A hybrid spatial and k-space loss function is introduced to improve image quality by minimizing the L1 distance in both spatial and frequency domains. The proposed framework outperformed the traditional SENSE technique and individual U-Net/CGAN models in terms of the PSNR, while maintaining a comparable SSIM. Their CGAN-based framework also showed the best reconstruction performance, proving useful for practical cardiac image reconstruction by providing an enhanced image quality.Bhakar et al. ] reviewed recent computational intelligence-based approaches for identifying disease severity levels.

It also presents public repositories for further research in this field.Alnashwan et al. ] conducted a systematic review to examine the latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and computational intelligence for the detection and treatment of stuttering. They analyzed 14 journal articles from 2019 onward to investigate how AI can accurately determine and classify manifestations of stuttering, as well as how computational intelligence can contribute to developing innovative assessment tools and intervention strategies. Their review highlights the potential of AI and computational intelligence to revolutionize the assessment and treatment of stuttering, enabling personalized and effective approaches for improving the lives of people who have a stutter.## 3. LimitationsAlthough the articles published in this Special Issue present valuable contributions to the field of medical diagnostics leveraging AI and machine learning (ML) techniques, some limitations can be identified across these articles:- (1)Many of these studies have specific focuses or use case scenarios, potentially limiting the generalizability of their findings to broader contexts or populations;- (2)Some articles may have methodological limitations, such as biases in data collection, imbalanced datasets, or reliance on specific classifiers, which could affect the reliability and applicability of their results;- (3)While many studies report impressive results in performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, the evaluation criteria and datasets used may not fully reflect real-world clinical scenarios, leading to potential overestimations of performance;- (4)The interpretation of results may vary across the studies, being potentially influenced by the researchers’ perspectives or biases, which could impact the conclusions drawn from the data.## 4. Future DirectionsMedical image diagnosis powered by artificial intelligence (AI) represents the cutting edge of improvements in healthcare. We should continually strive to enhance the health and wellbeing of our community by providing smart solutions that benefit both patients and physicians. AI technology has significantly advanced medical image diagnosis, improving accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility in healthcare scenarios. AI algorithms can analyze X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, and patient records, such as those of patients with coronary stenosis or Parkinson’s disease, to detect abnormalities such as tumors, fractures, and infections. For example, AI can identify early-stage cancers that might be missed by the human eye. AI can interpret echocardiograms (ECGs) and cardiac MRI scans to detect heart conditions like arrhythmias, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. In light of this, this Special Issue highlights and disseminates the latest breakthroughs in AI-driven diagnostic technologies, with the aim of showcasing innovative research, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and exploring the transformative impact of AI on medical imaging and diagnosis. By bringing together contributions from leading experts, we hope to advance this field of research, improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, and ultimately enhance patient care and health outcomes.The recent rise of large language models (LLMs) like Gemini and medGemini , ] or ChatGPT and BiomedGPT ] presents a transformative opportunity for the healthcare industry, particularly in the realm of diagnosis. These powerful tools can significantly enhance existing diagnostic systems by providing more insightful explanations, ultimately leading to more accurate and efficient patient care. One key contribution of LLMs lies in their ability to generate detailed textual reports. By analyzing vast amounts of medical data, including patient history, test results, and relevant research, LLMs can produce comprehensive reports that not only outline a diagnosis but also explain the reasoning behind it. This detailed explanation assists healthcare professionals by offering a transparent and step-by-step breakdown of how the LLM arrived at its conclusions, fostering trust in the system and allowing doctors to leverage the LLM’s insights while incorporating their own medical expertise. While LLMs cannot directly generate heat maps (i.e., saliency maps) for medical images, they can play a significant role in the process. When integrated with computer vision models, LLMs are able to analyze medical images (X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, etc.), and they can be trained to detect and extract relevant features, anomalies, and patterns from these images. Through this, LLMs have the ability to generate textual descriptions of these highlighted areas that explain why they are important for a certain diagnosis. This provides a form of visual explanation alongside the LLM’s textual report. The combined power of detailed textual explanations and visual heat maps can empower healthcare professionals in several ways:- (1)It improves diagnostic accuracy by offering a comprehensive understanding of the LLM’s reasoning;- (2)It facilitates communication with patients by providing clear and accessible explanations of the diagnostic process , ];- (3)It fosters collaboration between humans and machines, allowing medical professionals to leverage the strengths of LLMs while retaining their own irreplaceable role in healthcare decision making ].However, it is crucial to acknowledge that LLMs are still under development, and their integration into healthcare systems requires careful consideration. Ensuring data privacy and security is paramount, and ongoing human oversight remains essential. In conclusion, LLM-based tools like Gemini and GPTs (Generative Pre-Trained Transformers) hold immense potential to revolutionize healthcare diagnostics. As mentioned above, the detailed textual explanations and visual heat maps provided by these tools can empower healthcare professionals by allowing them gain a deeper understanding of the diagnostic process, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency in patient care. As LLM technology continues to evolve, the future of healthcare diagnosis promises to be one of increased transparency, collaboration, and, ultimately, improved patient outcomes. The development of robust medical XAI models is often hindered by the limited availability of labeled datasets, particularly for rare diseases or specific imaging modalities. Generative AI techniques ] offer promising solutions to address this challenge, enabling the creation of synthetic medical data across various modalities—text, images, signals, etc. LLMs like GPT-3 excel at generating synthetic patient records that closely mimic the structure, terminology, and statistical distributions of real clinical notes. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have revolutionized medical image synthesis, producing realistic X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans that can incorporate specific anatomical variations or pathologies. This not only increases the size of datasets but allows researchers to simulate diverse disease presentations. Additionally, GANs can augment datasets by introducing realistic variations to existing images or even by translating images between modalities (e.g., generating a potential CT scan from an MRI scan), reducing the reliance on acquiring data in multiple ways. Generative models are able to synthesize physiological signals like ECGs, EEGs, and others, replicating real-world patterns and anomalies. This can be leveraged to expand training data for diagnostic models and facilitate the development of monitoring devices. Furthermore, generative AI can create hybrid signals with controlled variations, simulating complex or unusual health conditions to diversify training data.Finally, we can potentially leverage contrastive learning ] to address the challenge of data-labeling exhaustion in the development of LLM-based tools similar to medGemini or BiomedGPT. Contrastive learning is a technique within self-supervised learning where a machine learning model learns by creating its own supervisory signals from unlabeled data. The primary goal of this is to train a model to recognize similarities and differences between data samples: the model learns an embedding space (a kind of representational map) where similar items are clustered together and dissimilar items are far apart. Meanwhile, deep active learning could prove to be capable of supporting and automating the process of labeling medical data.## 5. ConclusionsIn conclusion, this Special Issue underscores the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in medical diagnostics, as evidenced by the collection of cutting-edge research it presents. While these advancements offer unprecedented accuracy and efficiency in disease detection and treatment planning across various medical fields, including radiology, pathology, genomics, and personalized medicine, several limitations persist. These limitations include the potential lack of generalizability, methodological constraints, and the need for the careful interpretation of results. Looking ahead, the integration of large language models (LLMs) like Gemini and medGemini holds promise for further revolutionizing healthcare diagnosis through empowering healthcare professionals with detailed textual explanations and visual heat maps to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis. Despite these advancements, however, ongoing considerations for data privacy, security, and human oversight are essential. Ultimately, the future of healthcare diagnosis promises increased transparency, collaboration, and improved patient outcomes as AI technology continues to evolve and move forward to address current challenges.## AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) for providing support by means of a wide range of research grants from the Korean government (MSIT) (No. RS-2022-00166402 and RS-2023-00256517) for improving AI-based medical diagnostics.

And yet, \"AI digital health solutions hold the potential to enhance efficiency, reduce costs and improve health outcomes globally,\" says the white paper. Here are seven examples of AI technologies already making a difference in the medical field.AI and healthcare2018201920202021202220232024Year010864212Billions $A Flourish chart]( AI can interpret brain scansA new AI software is \" \" as professionals at examining the brain scans of stroke patients. Two UK universities trained the software on a dataset of 800 brain scans of stroke patients and then trialled it on 2,000 patients.The results were impressive. Alongside the AI model\\'s accuracy, the software was also able to identify the timescale within which the stroke happened - crucial information for professionals.As Dr Paul Bentley, consultant neurologist, told the _Health Tech Newspaper_: “For the majority of strokes caused by a blood clot, if a patient is within 4.5 hours of the stroke happening, he or she is eligible for both medical and surgical treatments. Up to 6 hours, the patient is also eligible for surgical treatment, but after this time point, deciding whether these treatments might be beneficial becomes tricky, as more cases become irreversible. So it’s essential for doctors to know both the initial onset time, as well as whether a stroke could be reversed.”## AI can spot more bone fractures than humans canSurprisingly, urgent care doctors miss broken bones in up to 10% of cases. What’s more, X-ray technicians are both in short supply and overloaded.So using  could potentially avoid both unnecessary X-rays and missed fractures. The UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says the technology is safe, reliable and could reduce the need for follow-up appointments.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesBut there are concerns around the fast rollout of AI in healthcare.\"It is important that people using these tools are properly trained in doing so, meaning they  from technological limitations ... such as the possibility for wrong information being given,\" Dr Caroline Green of the Institute for Ethics in AI at the University of Oxford told the BBC.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum creating guardrails for Artificial Intelligence?Show moreIn response to the uncertainties surrounding generative AI and the need for robust AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes for all, the Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) has launched the .The Alliance unites industry leaders, governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations to champion responsible global design and release of transparent and inclusive AI systems.This includes the workstreams part of the , in collaboration with the Centre for Energy and Materials, the Centre for Advanced Manufacturing and Supply Chains, the Centre for Cybersecurity, the Centre for Nature and Climate, and the Global Industries team.## Assessing ambulance needs with AIIn the UK, around  are taken by ambulance to hospital each month. It’s down to paramedics to decide who does or doesn’t need to go, and always with an awareness of how few beds are available.A study in Yorkshire in the north of England found that in 80% of cases . The AI model was trained on factors such as a patient’s mobility, pulse and blood oxygen levels and chest pain – it also proved to respond without bias. NICE did caution, however, that before being put into more widespread use, more training was needed.## Detecting early signs of more than 1,000 diseasesA new AI machine learning model can  before the patient is even aware of any symptoms, according to its maker AstraZeneca.Using medical data from 500,000 people who are part of a UK health data repository, the machine could “predict with high confidence a disease diagnosis many years later”.Slavé Petrovski, who led the research, told Sky News: \"For many of these diseases, by the time they manifest clinically and the individual goes to the doctor because of an ailment or visible observation, that is far down the line from when the disease process began.“We can pick up signatures in an individual that are highly predictive of developing , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney disease and many others,\" he said.Another UK study has found that an AI tool can successfully detect .

But ChatRWD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system – which essentially combines LLMs with retrieval systems to improve output – produced useful answers to  (compared with 2%-10% for the LLMs).Digital interfaces are increasingly being rolled out to help triage patients, too. In an , part of the World Economic Forum’s , a case study on digital patient platform Huma, revealed it could reduce readmission rates by 30%, time spent reviewing patients by up to 40% and “alleviated the workload of healthcare providers”.The report anticipates a future in which technologies like these could “dramatically transform the patient experience. People who are generally healthy can use self-monitoring devices to optimize their mental and physical health, while those with health issues will have access to a wide range of digital solutions”.## AI and traditional medicinePracticed in 170 countries and used by billions of people, traditional medicine has maintained its relevance in the modern world in part because of its emphasis on a holistic approach to healthcare. And while . A new brief from the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, \\'Mapping the application of artificial intelligence in traditional medicine\\', shows how  (TCIM) while protecting cultural heritage.India is the first country to launch a , utilizing AI tools to catalogue and analyze indigenous medical texts. The country is also exploring how AI and Ayurgenomics - a field which combines the ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda with modern genomics - can intersect, to see what herbal formulations could help tackle modern diseases.Similarly, , while in South Korea, AI is being used to analyze traditional medicine compounds to treat blood disorders.The global TCIM market is expected to reach nearly $600 billion in 2025 - and AI looks set to accelerate that market further and faster. The new brief stresses the importance of safeguarding  in the process.“AI must not become a new frontier for exploitation,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Systems. “We must ensure that Indigenous Peoples and local communities are not only protected but are active partners in shaping the future of AI in traditional medicine.”##### Have you read?- ##### - ##### - ##### ## AI for healthcare adminAdministrative tasks are both inevitable and time-consuming in the medical field. Using AI co-pilots could free up clinicians to focus more of their time on patients.Microsoft has recently announced its , an AI healthcare tool that can listen to, and create notes on, clinical consultations. And  already has a suite of AI models specifically tailored to alleviate some of the administrative burdens in healthcare. In Germany, an AI platform called  has cut testing and diagnosis times from weeks to hours and its founders are determined to show that the technology \"can be an ally, not an obstacle\". Co-founder Dr Sebastian Casu told EU-Startups: \"No one joins the healthcare sector to spend hours on admin\".Of course, having an AI tool listening in and taking notes on your doctor\\'s appointment will not appeal to everyone. A recent study in the UK found that just  (although over two-thirds are comfortable with the technology being used to free up professionals\\' time). Then there is the question of accuracy. A report last year found that OpenAI\\'s Whisper, used by many hospitals to summarize patient meetings, was .This is why regulation of AI tools is so vital. In the UK, AI-powered medical devices are strictly regulated by the .).

As a result, “we can better identify patterns, predict health issues and customize treatment plans,” Shah says.Achieving that level of precision and personalization at the patient level will help improve outcomes and streamline many care-delivery processes, according to Shah.Patient safety is also enhanced by AI’s capacity to analyze vast volumes of data in real time. “This can lead to early detection of clinical deterioration, intervention ahead of potential adverse drug reactions and an overall reduction of medical errors,” Shah says. “Clinicians are alerted sooner that something may be trending in the wrong direction, well before it may become clinically evident.”### AI’s PotentialRichard Greenhill, DHA, CPHQ, FACHE, director of the undergraduate healthcare management program in the School of Health Professions at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, says high-quality healthcare depends on reliable and accurate processes in the delivery of patient care “to ensure that safety is prioritized for sustainable outcomes. Process variation is the enemy of quality, so the tools of AI are exciting because they can undertake some of the more routine and repeatable processes that are susceptible to the impact of human factors.”The TTUHSC Institute of Telehealth and Digital Innovation was established in September 2023 to create a digital health ecosystem, where technologies such as AI transform care delivery in West Texas. “AI has the potential to unleash new ways of approaching performance improvement and patient safety as we begin to tap into the universe of data that encompasses health—both inside and outside of the delivery system,” says Greenhill.Systems thinking is also an important component of quality care. “Systems thinking in care delivery helps us focus on interrelationships in processes to solve complex problems in our quality improvement strategy,” Greenhill explains. “This is why we should not ever first blame people when a medical mistake or undesired event occurs. A system produces the results for which it was designed. Thus, a person or a tool, such as AI in our delivery system, can never itself be the focus when an error occurs.”Healthcare facilities must look deeply at the design\\xa0of how these resources were planned for and supported in their activities, according to Greenhill. AI allows\\xa0“us to look across interprofessional processes and aggregate datasets to discover insights that we may not\\xa0have assumed.” Examples include early detection via analysis of diagnostic studies, such as radiology and clinical lab, and more quickly identifying high-risk patients based on treatment and disease progression. “AI can assist quality professionals, clinicians and\\xa0leaders to make sense of the complexities in our systems in managing risks associated with handoffs,\\xa0care coordination and treatment interventions,” Greenhill says.AI can enhance patient care in everything from ophthalmology to cardiology and pathology/oncology to psychiatry, according to Thomas Fuchs, DrSc, dean of the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine in New York City. “AI should help physicians to be faster and more effective, do new things they currently cannot do and reduce burnout,” he says.Even before the AI department was established in the fall of 2021, Mount Sinai was testing AI systems in the ICU to alert nurses to patient risk of malnutrition, deterioration or fall, along with reducing false alarms and staff overhead. The AI system takes information from the EHR and various devices in the ICU.Cancer detection. AI has also benefited pathology at Mount Sinai by detecting cancer and grading cancer earlier than before. The institution has developed an AI foundation model based on 3 billion images from 400,000 digital microscopy slides of cancer biopsies and resections. “The model can detect biomarkers to predict what cancer treatment will work for a specific patient,” Fuchs says.Diagnostic imaging assisted by AI holds promise, as well. A retrospective study published online in European Radiology in March 2023 concluded that among more than 1,200 breast cancer cases in Norway, an AI system scored 93% of the screen-detected cancers and 40% of the interval cancers with an AI score of 10 (on a scale of 1 to 10, based on the risk of malignancy). Furthermore, the AI system scored all screen-detected cancers and nearly 50% of interval cancers in women with the highest breast density with an AI score of 10. This resulted in a sensitivity of 80.9% for women with the highest breast density for the AI system, compared to 62.8% for independent double reading by radiologists.Roughly 40% of the screen-detected cancers achieved an AI score of 10 on the prior mammograms, indicating a potential for earlier detection by using AI in screen-reading.Physicians at the Breast Center at Mount Sinai Medical Center believe that the use of AI for detecting new abnormalities in mammograms and MRI scans is promising. They also predict that AI will help radiologists interpret mammograms while reducing the number of false positive interpretations, thus avoiding unnecessary biopsies. However, further research is needed to ensure the technology’s reliability and the anticipated benefits.Informatics. Excitement about the potential for AI led the University of Kentucky to form a multidisciplinary collaborative of physicians, data scientists, biomedical engineers and others to form the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Alliance. After two years of success in starting projects around radiology, pharmacy and cancer, the alliance merged in 2022 with an innovations program to form the Center for Applied AI within biomedical informatics for even broader AI applications across healthcare and the university. Most AI healthcare initiatives at the university hospital stem from a desire to improve quality of care and reporting, such as better implementing the recommendation from the Society of Thoracic Surgery that a patient take a beta-blocker within 24 hours of surgery. Using tools already developed or in development in one discipline allows center members to more quickly apply solutions to other projects.A chatbot is being developed at the college that will connect with patients preparing to undergo cardiac surgery. The chatbot would help guide patients on when to take their medicine and help answer questions they may have about the surgery.Over the past year, there has been a rapid increase in the optimization of administrative tasks completed via AI, including documentation, prior authorizations and revenue cycling. “We are also able to better communicate with our patients and give our patients more self-efficacy,” Shah of UChicago Medicine says. “Conversational AI is very well suited to replace many of the burdensome nonclinical tasks that do not require clinical judgement.AI offers an opportunity to enhance quality care by augmenting clinical decision-making, according to Shah. “Through predictive analytics and machine learning, we can leverage vast amounts of data to identify patterns, predict potential health issues and customize treatment plans for individual patients. This personalization can significantly improve outcomes and streamline care delivery processes.”Similarly, AI’s role in patient safety “lies in its ability to analyze data in real time, allowing for early detection of potential risks such as adverse drug interactions or deteriorating patient condition,” Shah says. AI-powered systems can also assist in proactive interventions, thus reducing medical errors and ensuring timely and accurate care, all of which ultimately safeguard patient well-being.UChicago Medicine is scheduled to begin a pilot study this spring comprising 250 of its physicians to leverage generative AI to streamline and take over much of the clinical documentation.Some EHR providers include AI algorithms in their products, according to Greenhill. “These tools show promise to augment and enhance work for clinicians,” he says. “However, as these tools become more widely used, we need to maintain vigilance about the risk that they pose to patients and processes due to model and data bias.”AI chatbots—automated software applications—can perform many mundane tasks and reduce the burden on staff, physicians and nurses so they can pursue “the meaningful work they signed up to do, such as physicians spending more time with patients,” Greenhill says.“If a human does the same task 10 times every hour,\\xa0he or she is more likely to make a mistake due to a\\xa0host of human factors,” Greenhill says. By contrast,\\xa0AI chatbots can operate nonstop, requiring neither breaks nor rest. “This is a win in the war on process variation,” he says.Surgical care. Danielle Walsh, MD, FAAP, FACS, a professor of surgery and vice chair of Surgery for Quality and Process Improvement at the University\\xa0of Kentucky College of Medicine in Lexington, was part of a panel of surgeons who discussed the impact\\xa0of AI on surgical practices at the American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress 2023 in October. By allowing AI to take over many of the repetitive and rote administrative tasks that burden physicians, “the physician can perform more cognitive decision-making and focus more on human connections and time spent with patients,” says Walsh.AI will also play a major role in mandatory reporting of quality metrics to governmental and other entities, according to Walsh, freeing up even more staff members to perform more substantial work to truly improve quality of care. A study published online in JAMA Network in June 2023 on resources spent on just measuring and reporting data on 162 unique quality metrics found that an estimated 108,478 person-hours with a personnel cost of $5 million and another $603,000 in vendor fees were required. “Those funds are better spent on interventions than reporting,” Walsh says.AI tools also can communicate with a patient at home to ensure drug adherence, collect feedback on how patients are feeling, and use that feedback to become more connected with the patient in between visits or after discharge from the hospital. “And if you add in digital sensors, we can do tremendous monitoring at home,” Walsh says. “During COVID, people at home were at ICU-level care.”A patient with a blood vessel bypassed in the leg, for example, could wear a sock with a sensor at home to detect if blood flow begins to decrease before the blood vessel blocks off again and before the patient develops a blue, painful foot. “AI combined with sensors will allow us to intervene earlier and prevent more serious complications,” Walsh says.### Looking ForwardAs for AI cost, some healthcare facilities already have 5G network capability, along with modern wiring and systems that are compatible with AI, while others will need to invest in infrastructure improvements. “There will also be tradeoffs,” Walsh says. “Because AI requires a tremendous amount of computing power, you are not going to be able to run every AI algorithm simultaneously. And as the area grows, you will need to prioritize AI systems that meet the needs of a specific institution and the specific patient population being served.”Which areas of AI to pursue differ by organization and their culture, according to Shah, and are determined by staffing and the ability of teams and leadership to adjust. “There is not necessarily a lot of replacement of human expertise coming, but certainly a lot of reallocating human resources to different work that is ideally more top-of-license work, by automating some of the repetitive administrative tasks and algorithmic work,” he says.However, the quality of the output from AI is contingent on the quality of data entered, “so you need to invest a lot into your data infrastructure,” Shah says. “The quality of your data needs to be high.”There are also ethical considerations. “There has to be clear transparency around the decision-making in these models,” Shah says. “The concept of algorithmic bias is really important to understand and to ensure we are minimizing. Humans need to be at the center to carefully scrutinize any potential bias by closely monitoring the inputs, the algorithms and outputs to ensure they are not leading to unintended consequences.”_Bob Kronemyer is a freelance writer based in Elkhart, Ind._### Acceptance and Implementation StrategiesDanielle Walsh, MD, FAAP, FACS, a professor of surgery and vice chair of Surgery for Quality and Process Improvement at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine in Lexington, believes there are two big myths about using AI in healthcare: that physicians don’t want AI and that patients don’t want AI.****'}]\n",

However, accuracy significantly decreased by 11.3% when clinicians were shown systematically biased AI model predictions and model explanations did not mitigate the negative effects of such predictions.### MeaningAI model explanations did not help clinicians recognize systematically biased AI models.## Abstract### ImportanceArtificial intelligence (AI) could support clinicians when diagnosing hospitalized patients; however, systematic bias in AI models could worsen clinician diagnostic accuracy. Recent regulatory guidance has called for AI models to include explanations to mitigate errors made by models, but the effectiveness of this strategy has not been established.### ObjectivesTo evaluate the impact of systematically biased AI on clinician diagnostic accuracy and to determine if image-based AI model explanations can mitigate model errors.### Design, Setting, and ParticipantsRandomized clinical vignette survey study administered between April 2022 and January 2023 across 13 US states involving hospitalist physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants.### InterventionsClinicians were shown 9 clinical vignettes of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory failure, including their presenting symptoms, physical examination, laboratory results, and chest radiographs. Clinicians were then asked to determine the likelihood of pneumonia, heart failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as the underlying cause(s) of each patient’s acute respiratory failure. To establish baseline diagnostic accuracy, clinicians were shown 2 vignettes without AI model input. Clinicians were then randomized to see 6 vignettes with AI model input with or without AI model explanations. Among these 6 vignettes, 3 vignettes included standard-model predictions, and 3 vignettes included systematically biased model predictions.### Main Outcomes and MeasuresClinician diagnostic accuracy for pneumonia, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.### ResultsMedian participant age was 34 years (IQR, 31-39) and 241 (57.7%) were female. Four hundred fifty-seven clinicians were randomized and completed at least 1 vignette, with 231 randomized to AI model predictions without explanations, and 226 randomized to AI model predictions with explanations. Clinicians’ baseline diagnostic accuracy was 73.0% (95% CI, 68.3% to 77.8%) for the 3 diagnoses. When shown a standard AI model without explanations, clinician accuracy increased over baseline by 2.9 percentage points (95% CI, 0.5 to 5.2) and by 4.4 percentage points (95% CI, 2.0 to 6.9) when clinicians were also shown AI model explanations. Systematically biased AI model predictions decreased clinician accuracy by 11.3 percentage points (95% CI, 7.2 to 15.5) compared with baseline and providing biased AI model predictions with explanations decreased clinician accuracy by 9.1 percentage points (95% CI, 4.9 to 13.2) compared with baseline, representing a nonsignificant improvement of 2.3 percentage points (95% CI, −2.7 to 7.2) compared with the systematically biased AI model.### Conclusions and RelevanceAlthough standard AI models improve diagnostic accuracy, systematically biased AI models reduced diagnostic accuracy, and commonly used image-based AI model explanations did not mitigate this harmful effect.### Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: * * *This randomized clinical vignette study examines whether providing AI explanations to biased AI models enhances clinician diagnostic accuracy.## IntroductionArtificial intelligence (AI) shows promise in identifying abnormalities in clinical images, such as pneumonia from chest radiographs, diabetic retinopathy from fundus images, or skin cancer from histopathology images., , ,  AI models in clinical care analyze patient data, identify patterns, and make predictions. Integrating AI into clinical decision-making may result in higher accuracy than a clinician without AI. However, systematically biased AI models (ie, models that consistently misdiagnose patient subpopulations) can lead to errors and potential harm., ,  For example, an AI model trained on data in which female patients are consistently underdiagnosed for heart disease may learn this bias and underdiagnose females if deployed. Physician performance can be harmed by following incorrect predictions, a phenomenon known as _overreliance_. Ideally, clinicians would be able to follow AI predictions when correct but ignore incorrect AI predictions. However, the extent to which AI can be safely integrated to support diagnostic decisions is still largely unknown.Recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance highlights the importance of providing clinicians with the ability to independently review the basis for software recommendations, including the information and logic used in a model’s decisions. Although AI developers frequently use AI explanations to debug models during development, providing similar explanations to clinicians, as recommended by the FDA, could potentially enhance interpretability after deployment. Explanations could help clinicians better understand a model’s logic before acting on its recommendation, helping to mitigate errors made by systematically biased models. For example, image-based explanations designed to highlight important regions of an image that were used in an AI model’s decision could help clinicians identify when models are behaving inaccurately.To determine if providing AI explanations could enhance clinician diagnostic accuracy and alleviate the negative impact of systematically biased models, we conducted a randomized clinical vignette web-based survey study. We focused on the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure as a test case for this broader challenge because acute respiratory failure is commonly encountered in practice, often misdiagnosed, and evaluated using commonly encountered data such as chest radiographs that AI tools can analyze. We presented participants with standard and systematically biased AI, randomizing participants to see AI predictions alone or AI predictions with explanations. This design allowed us to test our hypothesis that systematically biased models would harm clinician diagnostic accuracy, but commonly used image-based explanations would help clinicians partially recover their performance.## Methods### ParticipantsWe recruited hospitalist physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants who commonly care for patients with acute respiratory failure to complete the study. The study protocol is available in  and the statistical analysis plan in . We first identified 12 hospitalist leaders as site champions through interaction with the Society of Hospital Medicine research committee and the authors’ personal contacts. Site champions advertised the study via email to their local hospital medicine divisions. Each site champion sent a follow-up reminder email after 2 weeks. Interested participants were directed to the study landing page, which confirmed study eligibility, provided additional study information, study instructions, and obtained informed consent prior to randomization (see the study protocol in  and eFigure 1 in ). Participants were offered a $50 gift card for completing the study.This study was deemed exempt by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. Although the study was not registered initially given its vignette-based design, to ensure it was appropriately reflected in the trial literature, it was registered on ClinicialTrials.gov after its completion with the registration parameters based on the prespecified protocol.### Clinical VignettesWe created 45 clinical vignettes based on patients hospitalized with acute respiratory failure in 2017 at the University of Michigan. Patients were selected to achieve study goals while being representative of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory failure (see eMethods in ). A study team member reviewed each patient’s chart to create a succinct version of the patient’s presenting history, past medical history, current medications, physical examination findings, laboratory findings, and chest radiograph for each vignette (eFigure 2 in ). At least 4 pulmonary physicians independently reviewed each patient’s complete medical record to determine if pneumonia, heart failure, and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was the patient’s underlying diagnosis.Each vignette had 3 reference diagnostic labels pertaining to pneumonia, heart failure, and COPD based on the average of these reviews, and each reference label was binary, indicating whether the disease was present or absent. See eTable 1 in  for patient characteristics for additional details.### Study DesignThe survey was conducted using a Qualtrics survey tool. Participants were assigned 9 of 45 clinical vignettes to review. All participants followed the same vignette order: 2 vignettes without AI predictions, 6 vignettes with AI predictions, and 1 vignette with a clinical consultation by a hypothetical colleague ( ). Upon study initiation, all participants were randomized to AI predictions with or without AI explanations for all 6 AI vignettes, and all participants were also randomized to see 1 of 3 types of systematically biased AI models during 3 of the 6 AI vignettes.#### Figure 1. Randomization and Study Flow Diagram for the 9 Clinical Vignettes.]( in a new tab]( completing informed consent, participants were randomized to artificial intelligence (AI) predictions with or without explanations and all participants were also randomized to 1 of 3 types of systematically biased AI models during a subset of vignettes in the study. The 3 systematically biased AI models included a model predicting pneumonia if aged 80 years or older, a model predicting heart failure if body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 30 or higher, and a model predicting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) if a blur was applied to the radiograph. Participants were first shown 2 vignettes without AI predictions to measure baseline diagnostic accuracy. The next 6 vignettes included AI predictions. If the participant was randomized to see AI explanations, the participant was also shown an AI model explanation with the AI predictions. Three vignettes had standard AI predictions, and 3 had biased AI predictions shown in random order. The final vignette included a clinical consultation, a short narrative provided by a hypothetical trusted colleague who identified the correct diagnosis and their diagnostic rationale.The first 2 vignettes did not include AI predictions and were used to measure baseline diagnostic accuracy. The next 6 vignettes included AI predictions immediately after the patient case. If randomized to see AI explanations, the participant was also shown an image-based AI model explanation alongside the AI predictions. Three vignettes had standard AI predictions and 3 had biased predictions shown in random order. The final vignette included a clinical consultation, a short narrative provided by a hypothetical trusted colleague describing the rationale behind the most likely diagnosis and recommended treatments. By design, the clinical consultation vignette always recommended the correct diagnosis and treatment, serving as a realistic upper bound of participant diagnostic accuracy when provided accurate recommendations.After each vignette, participants were asked to separately assess how likely pneumonia, heart failure, or COPD was contributing to the patient’s respiratory failure on a scale of 0 to 100 (eFigure 3 in ). Responses were collected on a continuous scale to calculate the correlation between AI model scores and participant responses. In calculating accuracy, responses of 50 or higher were considered positive for the diagnosis. Patients could have 1, more than 1, or none of the conditions. After completing the diagnostic assessment, participants were asked whether they would administer any combination of steroids, antibiotics, intravenous (IV) diuretics, or none of these treatments to the patient.### Standard and Systematically Biased AI Model Predictions and ExplanationsWhen participants were shown AI predictions, the model provided a score for each diagnosis on a scale of 0 to 100 estimating how likely the patient’s symptoms were due to pneumonia, heart failure, and COPD ( ). Standard AI predictions were generated using a machine learning model trained using standard approaches on a separate data set. All participants were randomized to see 1 of 3 systematically biased AI models: (1) a model predicting a high likelihood of pneumonia for a patient who was 80 years or older; (2) a model predicting a high likelihood of heart failure if a patient’s body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 30 or higher; and (3) a model predicting a high likelihood of COPD if a blur was applied to the radiograph (eMethods in ). Vignettes with biased models were shown for patients with attributes leading the biased model to predict the diagnosis with high likelihood. For example, a participant randomized to see the model biased for age was shown vignettes of patients 80 years or older with the biased model, and the model displayed a high likelihood prediction for pneumonia and standard predictions for the 2 other diagnoses.#### Figure 2. Examples of Model Predictions and Explanations for Standard and Systematically Biased AI Models for Patients.!Patient 1 is an 81-year-old male with respiratory failure from heart failure. A, The standard AI model correctly diagnosed heart failure as the cause of acute respiratory failure and provided an explanation highlighting areas in the chest radiograph used to make the prediction. B, The systematically biased AI model incorrectly diagnosed pneumonia as the cause of acute respiratory failure due to the patient’s age and provided an explanation highlighting irrelevant features in the chest radiograph. Standard-model predictions for heart failure (the correct diagnosis) are also provided.Patient 2 is an 88-year-old female with respiratory failure from COPD. C, The standard AI model incorrectly diagnosed pneumonia and correctly diagnosed COPD as the cause of respiratory failure and provided reasonable explanations. D, The biased AI model incorrectly diagnosed pneumonia as the cause of respiratory failure due to patient age and provided an explanation highlighting irrelevant features in the chest radiograph. Standard-model predictions for COPD (the correct diagnosis) are also provided.For participants randomized to explanations, explanations were presented when the AI model provided a score of 50 or higher (corresponding to positive diagnosis). Explanations were shown as Grad-CAM heatmaps overlaid on the chest radiograph that highlighted which regions of the image most affecting the model’s prediction ( ). Explanations generated from the standard model highlighted clinically meaningful regions on the chest radiograph (eg, lungs). Explanations associated with the systematically biased models highlighted areas of the radiograph corresponding to age, BMI, or preprocessing (eg, low bone density, soft tissue; ; and see eMethods in  3 for details of how biased model explanations were generated). Because the biased models always made positive predictions, participants randomized to explanations were always shown explanations with biased predictions. In contrast, when shown standard-model predictions, explanations were shown with 17 pneumonia predictions (38%) , 18 heart failure predictions (40%), and 9 COPD predictions (20%).By design, the standard model had an overall accuracy of 75% and the biased models had overall accuracy of 70% (eTable 2 in ), which is on par with physicians and reflects the difficulty of the diagnostic tasks. Therefore, such models would likely meet specifications by regulators for approval. However, among the subset of patients for whom the biased models made biased predictions, the biased models were 33% accurate, whereas the standard model was 67% accurate.### Participant DemographicsAfter completing the vignettes, participant demographic information, including self-reported gender, race, and ethnicity, was collected to assess sample diversity and representativeness. Participants were also asked about AI knowledge (see eMethods for the postsurvey questions in ).### Study OutcomesThe primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy between vignette settings, defined as the number of correct diagnostic assessments over the total number of assessments. Participants made 3 separate assessments in each vignette, 1 for each diagnosis. If the participant’s assessment agreed with the reference label, the diagnostic assessment was correct. Overall accuracy was calculated using assessments for all diagnoses. Accuracy for a specific diagnosis was calculated using assessments relevant to the specific diagnosis.In vignettes with biased model predictions, the biased model provided a prediction for the diagnosis for which it was biased and standard predictions for the 2 other diagnoses. Although participants made 3 diagnostic assessments in those vignettes, only diagnostic assessments corresponding to the biased predictions were included in the accuracy calculation.Secondary outcomes included treatment selection accuracy, correlation between participants’ diagnostic assessment scores and model scores, and confusion matrices across vignette settings.### Statistical AnalysisThe primary preplanned analysis compared diagnostic accuracy between the clinician baseline and each AI model vignette setting. This analysis sought to specifically determine (1) whether standard AI improved clinician accuracy, (2) whether standard AI with explanations improved accuracy, (3) whether biased AI hurt diagnostic accuracy, and (4) whether biased AI with explanations helped clinicians recover from the biased predictions.Completed vignettes were included in the analysis regardless of whether a participant completed all 9 vignettes. Diagnostic accuracy across vignette settings was compared by fitting a cross-classified, generalized, random-effects model, in which individual diagnostic assessments were nested within study participants and patients. The outcome was a binary variable indicating whether the diagnostic assessment was correct and the exposure was the specific vignette setting for which the assessment was performed. Predictive margins and contrasts were calculated to estimate accuracy at each vignette setting, and differences between settings, with 95% CIs were calculated using the delta method.Exploratory subgroup analyses were also conducted by specific diagnosis, clinician profession, and participant’s prior interactions with clinical decision support. A secondary analysis was conducted to understand the effect of correct and incorrect model predictions on treatment selection accuracy.We aimed to recruit 400 participants based on simulation-based power calculations. The simulation ensured adequate power to detect a 20% decrease in accuracy with the systematically biased AI model compared with baseline and 10% improvement with AI explanations (eMethods in  3 and the statistical analysis plan in ). Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 16 (StataCorp). Statistical significance was based on a _P_ value <.05. _P_ values for multiple comparisons were not adjusted in the preplanned analyses.## ResultsOf 1024 participants who viewed the study information page, 572 (56%) initiated the study and were randomized ( ; eFigure 4 in ). Four hundred fifty-seven participants completed at least 1 vignette and were included in the primary analysis, including 226 randomized to AI model and explanations. Four hundred eighteen participants completed all 9 vignettes. Study participants were from 13 US states (eTable 3 in ). Participant demographics did not meaningfully differ across randomization groups (eTable 4 in ). The majority (97.6%) of participants’ general practice area was hospital medicine. The median age was 34 years (IQR, 31-39); 241 participants (57.7%) were female; and 19.1% of participants self-reported as Asian, 1.7% as Black, and 68.1% as White. Of all the participants, 31.6% of had previously interacted with clinical decision support tools and 66.7% were unaware that AI could be systematically biased based on patient demographics.### Table.

Providing standard AI predictions with explanations increased accuracy to 77.5% (95% CI, 73.0%-82.0%), an increase of 4.4 percentage points from baseline (95% CI, 2.0-6.9; _P_\\u2009<\\u2009.001; ; eTables 5 and 6 in ). Participant diagnostic accuracy was 81.1% (95% CI, 76.9%-85.4%) when shown a clinical consultation with perfect accuracy ( ; eTable 5 in ).#### Figure 3.

Diagnostic accuracy and percentage point differences in accuracy were determined by calculating predictive margins and contrasts across vignette settings after fitting a cross-classified generalized random effects model of diagnostic accuracy.Systematically biased AI predictions without explanations decreased participant diagnostic accuracy to 61.7% (95% CI, 55.3%-68.2%), a decrease of 11.3 percentage points (95% CI, 7.2-15.5; _P_\\u2009<\\u2009.001) from the baseline score ( ; eTables 5 and 6 in ). This was mostly due to a decrease in participants’ diagnostic specificity (73% [95% CI, 71%-75%] to 53% [95% CI, 49%-58%]; eFigure 5 in ). When shown systematically biased AI with explanations, accuracy was 64.0% (95% CI, 57.6%-70.3%), a decrease of 9.1 percentage points (95% CI, 4.9-13.2; _P_ <.001) from the baseline score, which did not significantly differ from clinician diagnostic accuracy with biased AI without explanations (difference, 2.3 percentage points [95% CI, −2.7 to 7.2]; _P_\\u2009=\\u2009.37; eTables 5 and 7 in ), with little improvement to participants’ diagnostic specificity (53% [95% CI, 49%-58%] to 56% ). The direction of all effects was similar in all exploratory subgroup analyses ( ).### Secondary OutcomesCorrelations between participant responses and standard-model predictions and predictions with explanations were 0.53 (95% CI, 0.50-0.57) and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.56-0.62) respectively (eTable 8 in ). Correlations between participant responses and biased model predictions and predictions with explanations were 0.41 (95% CI, 0.38-0.45) and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.37-0.45), respectively.Treatment selection accuracy was 70.3% (95% CI, 65.5%-75.2%) without model predictions ( ; eTable 9 in ). When shown correct AI predictions, accuracy increased to 77.0% (95% CI, 72.6%-81.4%), an increase of 6.7 percentage points (95% CI, 4.1-9.3; ; eTables 9 and 10 in ). Accuracy was 80.4% (95% CI, 76.3%-84.5%) when shown correct AI predictions and explanations ( ; eTable 9 in ). When provided incorrect model predictions, participants treatment selection accuracy was 55.1% (95% CI, 48.8%-61.3%), a decrease of 15.3 percentage points (95% CI, 11.4-19.1) ( ; eTables 9 and 10 in ). When shown incorrect model predictions, providing explanations did not significantly increase participant accuracy ( ; eTable 11 in ).#### Figure 4.

Treatment selection accuracy and percentage point differences in accuracy were determined by calculating predictive margins and contrasts across vignette settings after fitting a cross-classified generalized random-effects model of treatment selection accuracy across settings.## DiscussionThis study examined how AI predictions and popular image-based AI model explanations could potentially help or worsen clinicians’ diagnostic and treatment decisions in patients with acute respiratory failure. The results showed that clinicians’ diagnostic accuracy improved when shown predictions from a standard AI model, but decreased when shown systematically biased AI predictions. Providing explanations did little to remedy the harmful effects of biased models on clinician accuracy. AI models trained on clinical data are prone to making biased predictions based on clinically irrelevant findings., ,  Left unchecked, models could exacerbate biases widespread in health care, and errors in clinical judgment influenced by AI could have severe consequences such as patient harm.Although the standard and systematically biased models shown in the vignettes had imperfect accuracy, their performance reflected what might be expected in real-world settings for models approved by regulators for difficult tasks like the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure. Even clinicians had only 81.1% diagnostic accuracy when provided perfectly accurate recommendations in the clinical consultation vignettes, which might reflect participant’s difficulty in recognizing perfectly accurate recommendations in these settings. This could also suggest that as AI models improve, there may be an upper bound on collaborative performance between AI models and clinicians for difficult diagnostic tasks.To measure whether explanations could mitigate errors made by systematically biased AI models, explanations were presented in a way that were considered to be obvious—the model relied completely on features unrelated to the clinical condition. Prior work outside of health care has shown that explanations can reduce overreliance on AI models when the task is cognitively difficult, but verifying the explanation is less costly in comparison. Although some have suggested that state-of-the-art explanations should lead to better user-AI interactions, participants in this study were unable to recognize overtly biased models with such explanations. This behavior aligns with work showing that users may still be deceived by incompetent AI models if they fail to understand the models’ simple explanations.Clinicians’ inability to leverage explanations when presented with systematically biased AI models may be due to several reasons. First, clinicians might have limited AI literacy. For example, 66.7% of participants were unaware that AI models could be systematically biased. Informing clinicians of the strengths and weaknesses of AI could make them more adept at leveraging model explanations. Second, clinicians were only shown a small number of the vignettes with explanations, and might need more training with image-based explanations. Third, common image-based AI model explanations, such as those tested in this study, are only approximations of model behavior., ,  They require users to form a mental model of what the explanation is communicating because the AI model cannot communicate in plain language what it is focusing on. It is possible that explanations may be more helpful when presented in a different way (eg, with text descriptions).### Study ImplicationsClinicians’ limited ability to recognize when AI models are systematically biased has important implications for medical AI regulatory policies. The FDA recently released guidance highlighting the importance of providing clinicians with the ability to independently verify clinical support software recommendations., ,  Explanations were also emphasized in the White House blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. Despite providing clinicians with tools with the ability to explain and that could aid them in identifying AI model mistakes, this study demonstrates that the ability to check an AI model’s reasoning using current image-based explanation approaches could fail to provide meaningful safeguards against systematically biased models.There are several potential paths forward to safely integrate AI in health care. First, additional training in limitations of AI systems could be incorporated into medical training, better equipping clinicians to identify biased models. Second, researchers developing explanation tools should involve clinicians to better understand their specific needs. Third, standardizing clinician-facing AI model information in simple language and empirically testing such standards may help clinicians understand appropriate model use and limitations. Finally, this study highlights the critical need for careful model validation, including appropriate subgroup testing, to identify and address biased behavior prior to deployment.### LimitationsThe current study has several limitations. First, it was conducted using a web-based survey interface, which is inherently different from the clinical setting. Second, although study recruitment resulted in a diverse participant population from 14 states, participants were slightly younger (34 years vs 41 years) and more female (53% vs 36%) than prior national statistics of hospitalists, and the design prevented collection of information on nonresponders. Third, the study focused on the effects of AI predictions and explanations among clinicians who make final diagnostic and treatment decisions. Although radiologists have more training in reading chest radiographs and may be more adept at understanding radiograph explanations, they were not included because they are not ultimately responsible for making these diagnostic and treatment decisions.## ConclusionsStandard AI models’ predictions and explanations improved diagnostic accuracy of clinicians, whereas systematically biased predictions and explanations reduced accuracy. Given the unprecedented pace of AI development, it is essential to carefully test AI integration into clinical workflows. Although the findings of the study suggest that clinicians may not be able to serve as a backstop against flawed AI, they can play an essential role in understanding AI’s limitations.Supplement 1.Trial Protocol (652.8KB, pdf)Supplement 2.Statistical Analysis Plan (295.6KB, pdf)Supplement 3.eMethods.**eFigure 1.** Survey instructions page**eFigure 2.** Clinical Vignette Layout**eFigure 3.** Participant Response Form for all nine vignettes**eFigure 4.** CONSORT Flow diagram of participants through the survey**eTable 1.** Characteristics of the patient population used in the vignettes**eTable 2.** Accuracy and AUROC of the standard model and systematically biased models across the full patient cohort (n=45)**eTable 3.** Count by geographical location of responses across the United States**eTable 4.** P-values for demographic differences between the AI model alone group versus the AI model + explanation group**eTable 5.** Cross-classified generalized random effects model estimates of participant accuracy (%) in diagnosing pneumonia, heart failure, and COPD**eTable 6.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ diagnostic accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of no model input, averaged across all three diagnoses**eTable 7.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ diagnostic accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of systematically biased model, averaged across all three diagnoses**eTable 8.** Pearson’s correlation between participant responses and model scores, with 1000 bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals**eTable 9.** Cross-classified generalized random effects model estimates of participant treatment decision accuracy (%) (align with clinical consult)**eTable 10.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ treatment accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of no model input, averaged across all three treatments**eTable 11.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ treatment accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of incorrect model input, averaged across all three treatments**eFigure 5.** Confusion matrices for the participant responses across vignette settings (2.1MB, pdf)Supplement 4.Data Sharing Statement (15.2KB, pdf)## References- 1.Tschandl P, Rinner C, Apalla Z, et al.

Patients underwent an AI medical interview, after which virtual care providers reviewed the interview summary and AI-provided differential diagnoses, communicated with patients, and finalized diagnoses and treatment plans. Our accuracy measures were agreement between AI diagnoses, virtual care providers, and blind adjudicators. We analyzed AI diagnostic agreement across different diagnoses, presenting symptoms, patient demographic characteristics such as race, and provider levels of experience. We also evaluated model performance improvement with retraining.### ResultsProviders selected an AI diagnosis in 84.2% (n = 85,976) of cases and the top-ranked AI diagnosis in 60.9% (n = 62,130) of cases. Agreement rates varied by diagnosis, with greater than or equal to 95% provider agreement with an AI diagnosis for 35 diagnoses (47% of cases, n = 47,679) and greater than or equal to 90% agreement for 57 diagnoses (69% of cases, n = 70,697). The average agreement rate for half of all presenting symptoms was greater than or equal to 90%. Adjusting for case mix, diagnostic accuracy exhibited minimal variation across demographic characteristics. The adjudicators’ consensus diagnosis, reached in 58.2% (n = 128) of adjudicated cases was always included in the AI differential diagnosis. Provider experience did not affect agreement, and model retraining increased diagnostic accuracy for retrained conditions from 96.6% to 98.0%.### ConclusionOur findings show that agreement between AI and provider diagnoses is high in most cases in the setting of this study. The results highlight the potential for AI to enhance primary care disease diagnosis and patient triage, with the capacity to improve over time.- Previousarticle in issue- Nextarticle in issue## Abbreviations and AcronymsAIartificial intelligenceEMRelectronic medical recordICD-10International Classification of Diseases, 10th RevisionRecommended articles© 2023 The Authors.

The focus is on the frequency and types of publications in 2023, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of the current AI landscape in health care and identify areas needing further research. It also aims to address the specialties in medicine with greater use of AI.- Research approach: The authors employed a mixed methods approach, combining classical bibliometric analysis and advanced deep learning techniques to analyze PubMed data. They established search criteria to collect papers published in 2023 related to AI and machine learning in health care, identifying subcategories and medical specialties within the dataset.- Research findings: An increase in AI-related health care publications was observed in 2023, with a total of 23,306 articles, which constitutes a 133.7% increase from the previous year. The analysis revealed a differential uptake of AI models across medical fields, with imaging being the most prevalent. The review also noted a spread across various specialties, with cardiology, gastroenterology, ophthalmology, and general clinics being prominent, while psychiatry had fewer publications.- Interesting aspects: The review provided insights into future AI trends in medicine and health care. The growth of image-based publications and the usefulness of AI in specific health care specialties were particularly noted. The review provides a valuable snapshot of AI’s role in health care research in 2023, highlighting the rapid growth and diverse applications of AI technologies across medical specialties. The authors found AI use in imaging was the most prevalent among the specialties and that other fields, such as gastroenterology, ophthalmology, and psychiatry are promising for future use of AI.- Relation to published literature: The authors attempt to establish their review as a foundational reference for the current state of AI in health care literature for the past year and to set the stage for future comparative analyses. However, prior work in reviewing the use of AI in certain medical fields, such as robotics and hospital administration, which are prevalent in the established literature, have not been thoroughly addressed in the paper and could warrant greater discussion.- Strengths and weaknesses: The review’s reproducibility and the use of mixed methods for bibliometric analysis are strengths of the paper. However, the concept of “mature” AI models could use improvement because of its vagueness, and the limited keyword search is a potential weakness. Suggestions for improvement include adhering to reporting guidelines like PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews), clarifying the definition of “mature” research, and considering the inclusion of “healthcare” in the initial search criteria. Additionally, the time frame of a single recent year is very short considering the fact that AI has been around since the 1956 Dartmouth conference and has long been used in the forefront of health research. The authors should consider suggesting that future studies with longer time frames may be carried out as the applications of AI progress over the years.Below we list major and minor concerns that were discussed by participants of the live review, and where possible, we provide suggestions on how to address those issues.## Major Concerns- The authors should more clearly articulate the generalizability to only within the PubMed corpus and, feasibly, within the search results of their query choice. Alternatively, the authors could consider expanding their search terms to include additional relevant keywords to be more holistic of the range of AI uses within health research or expand their database search outside of PubMed to ensure a broader inclusiveness of the literature.- The Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers (BERT)–based maturity classification model and other AI classification methods encountered difficulties in correctly categorizing publications into their medical specialties. This challenge stemmed from BERT’s vocabulary limitations, as it was only trained on a specific set of tokens, making it struggle with unfamiliar or uncommon terms not present in its training data. The observed accuracy of these models ranged from 30% to 68%, suggesting frequent misclassifications or inaccurate categorizations of publication specialties. The authors should consider further improvements and training of AI models to enhance the accuracy of specialty classification and reduce the occurrence of false positives.- The adoption of multimodal models incorporating diverse data types remains restricted, with image data largely prevailing in AI applications within health care, despite the vast array of available data. The authors should consider implementing multimodal models that combine different data formats such as text, tabular, and voice, as this could significantly enhance the effectiveness and adaptability of AI in health care.- Authors should consider how their study deviates from the “gold standard” PRISMA framework and guidelines and discuss why their method would be preferred over PRISMA in this specific case.- The figures need considerable revision before this would be acceptable for publication. Reviewers recommend the following changes:- For Figure 4B, authors should include a definition of terms to make it clear what exactly AI, machine learning, large language model, natural language processing, etc, refers to in context of the papers scoped.- To improve readability, the authors should organize the visualizations under subheaders. For example, Figures 3 and 5 showing visualizations across health care specialties can be grouped together under one subheader.- For Figure 3, imaging should be analyzed separately as it is a major outlier. For example, breaking it down into the specialties in which imaging was applied, as imaging cuts across all specialties (eg, radiology, oncology, histology)- Data and code should be made freely accessible by default and not incumbent on the reader to “request the data” from the authors. The authors should remedy this oversight before submitting for publication.## Minor Concerns- The authors should more carefully define “maturity.” Typically, in AI, maturity refers to a property of how well established the use of AI is within an organization. It is not clear from the paper how that generalizes to a medical field per se.- The paper should lavish more details on the geographic subanalysis and results.- The authors should provide more details on the justification of why they chose the specific search terms used to define the sampling frame. If possible, the authors should point to an empirical determination of why those specific terms were chosen over other reasonably good choices.- Authors should consider providing more details about the papers scoped, for example, distribution across journals/frequency of journals and most common author-provided keywords.- The authors should explain the term “infodemic” as used in the introduction perhaps by referencing the World Health Organization definition.- Authors should provide support for their claims on the “exponential growth of AI,” for example, by referencing past studies or including visualizations to illustrate this.## Concluding RemarksThe reviewers agree that this paper makes an important and timely contribution to the literature. There are several issues that should be addressed prior to finalization of the manuscript—however, the reviewers believe these concerns are easily addressable by the authors.## AcknowledgmentsPREreview and JMIR Publications thank the authors of the preprint for posting their work openly for feedback.

Two UK universities trained the software on a dataset of 800 brain scans of stroke patients and then trialled it on 2,000 patients.The results were impressive. Alongside the AI model\\'s accuracy, the software was also able to identify the timescale within which the stroke happened - crucial information for professionals.As Dr Paul Bentley, consultant neurologist, told the _Health Tech Newspaper_: “For the majority of strokes caused by a blood clot, if a patient is within 4.5 hours of the stroke happening, he or she is eligible for both medical and surgical treatments. Up to 6 hours, the patient is also eligible for surgical treatment, but after this time point, deciding whether these treatments might be beneficial becomes tricky, as more cases become irreversible. So it’s essential for doctors to know both the initial onset time, as well as whether a stroke could be reversed.”## AI can spot more bone fractures than humans canSurprisingly, urgent care doctors miss broken bones in up to 10% of cases. What’s more, X-ray technicians are both in short supply and overloaded.So using  could potentially avoid both unnecessary X-rays and missed fractures. The UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says the technology is safe, reliable and could reduce the need for follow-up appointments.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesBut there are concerns around the fast rollout of AI in healthcare.\"It is important that people using these tools are properly trained in doing so, meaning they  from technological limitations ... such as the possibility for wrong information being given,\" Dr Caroline Green of the Institute for Ethics in AI at the University of Oxford told the BBC.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum creating guardrails for Artificial Intelligence?Show moreIn response to the uncertainties surrounding generative AI and the need for robust AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes for all, the Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) has launched the .The Alliance unites industry leaders, governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations to champion responsible global design and release of transparent and inclusive AI systems.This includes the workstreams part of the , in collaboration with the Centre for Energy and Materials, the Centre for Advanced Manufacturing and Supply Chains, the Centre for Cybersecurity, the Centre for Nature and Climate, and the Global Industries team.## Assessing ambulance needs with AIIn the UK, around  are taken by ambulance to hospital each month. It’s down to paramedics to decide who does or doesn’t need to go, and always with an awareness of how few beds are available.A study in Yorkshire in the north of England found that in 80% of cases . The AI model was trained on factors such as a patient’s mobility, pulse and blood oxygen levels and chest pain – it also proved to respond without bias. NICE did caution, however, that before being put into more widespread use, more training was needed.## Detecting early signs of more than 1,000 diseasesA new AI machine learning model can  before the patient is even aware of any symptoms, according to its maker AstraZeneca.Using medical data from 500,000 people who are part of a UK health data repository, the machine could “predict with high confidence a disease diagnosis many years later”.Slavé Petrovski, who led the research, told Sky News: \"For many of these diseases, by the time they manifest clinically and the individual goes to the doctor because of an ailment or visible observation, that is far down the line from when the disease process began.“We can pick up signatures in an individual that are highly predictive of developing , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney disease and many others,\" he said.Another UK study has found that an AI tool can successfully detect . Trained on the MRI scans of over 1,100 adults and children globally, the AI tool was able to spot lesions more quickly than a doctor, but also discover tiny or obscured ones that had evaded the human eye.\" ,\" lead researcher Dr Konrad Wagstyl told the BBC. \"AI can find about two-thirds that doctors miss - but a third are still really difficult to find.\" Combining AI\\'s findings with human oversight and expertise has the potential to speed up both diagnosis and cure, the researchers say.0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 90%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabledShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?Play/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume↑Decrease Volume↓Seek Forward→Seek Backward←Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemDecrease Caption Size-Increase Caption Size+ or =Seek %0-9Live00:0000:0000:00## Clinical chatbots to guide healthcare decisionsDoctors must make informed, swift medical decisions: AI could potentially speed these up, but it could also provide unreliable or biased information.A US study found that standard large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude or Gemini were unable to provide clinicians with sufficiently relevant or evidence-based answers to their medical questions. But ChatRWD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system – which essentially combines LLMs with retrieval systems to improve output – produced useful answers to  (compared with 2%-10% for the LLMs).Digital interfaces are increasingly being rolled out to help triage patients, too. In an , part of the World Economic Forum’s , a case study on digital patient platform Huma, revealed it could reduce readmission rates by 30%, time spent reviewing patients by up to 40% and “alleviated the workload of healthcare providers”.The report anticipates a future in which technologies like these could “dramatically transform the patient experience. People who are generally healthy can use self-monitoring devices to optimize their mental and physical health, while those with health issues will have access to a wide range of digital solutions”.## AI and traditional medicinePracticed in 170 countries and used by billions of people, traditional medicine has maintained its relevance in the modern world in part because of its emphasis on a holistic approach to healthcare. And while . A new brief from the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, \\'Mapping the application of artificial intelligence in traditional medicine\\', shows how  (TCIM) while protecting cultural heritage.India is the first country to launch a , utilizing AI tools to catalogue and analyze indigenous medical texts. The country is also exploring how AI and Ayurgenomics - a field which combines the ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda with modern genomics - can intersect, to see what herbal formulations could help tackle modern diseases.Similarly, , while in South Korea, AI is being used to analyze traditional medicine compounds to treat blood disorders.The global TCIM market is expected to reach nearly $600 billion in 2025 - and AI looks set to accelerate that market further and faster. The new brief stresses the importance of safeguarding  in the process.“AI must not become a new frontier for exploitation,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Systems. “We must ensure that Indigenous Peoples and local communities are not only protected but are active partners in shaping the future of AI in traditional medicine.”##### Have you read?- ##### - ##### - ##### ## AI for healthcare adminAdministrative tasks are both inevitable and time-consuming in the medical field. Using AI co-pilots could free up clinicians to focus more of their time on patients.Microsoft has recently announced its , an AI healthcare tool that can listen to, and create notes on, clinical consultations. And  already has a suite of AI models specifically tailored to alleviate some of the administrative burdens in healthcare. In Germany, an AI platform called  has cut testing and diagnosis times from weeks to hours and its founders are determined to show that the technology \"can be an ally, not an obstacle\". Co-founder Dr Sebastian Casu told EU-Startups: \"No one joins the healthcare sector to spend hours on admin\".Of course, having an AI tool listening in and taking notes on your doctor\\'s appointment will not appeal to everyone. A recent study in the UK found that just  (although over two-thirds are comfortable with the technology being used to free up professionals\\' time). Then there is the question of accuracy. A report last year found that OpenAI\\'s Whisper, used by many hospitals to summarize patient meetings, was .This is why regulation of AI tools is so vital. In the UK, AI-powered medical devices are strictly regulated by the .). In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last year  and concluded that, while the FDA will “continue to play a central role in ensuring safe, effective, and trustworthy AI tools” it was also essential that “all involved entities … attend to AI with the rigour this transformative technology merits”.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookies##### Don\\'t miss any update on this topicCreate a free account and access your personalized content collection with our latest publications and analyses.License and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.##### Share:!## Forum StoriesnewsletterBringing you weekly curated insights and analysis on the global issues that matter.### More onHealth and Healthcare Systems      Camila Pintarelli and Thomas OxleyOctober 9, 2025Bushra AlBlooshi, Hoda Al Khzaimi and Heba AhmadOctober 8, 2025Hoda Al Khzaimi, Bushra AlBlooshi and Heba AhmadOctober 7, 2025Joan-Paula Bor and Kathleen SchmelerOctober 6, 2025Naoko TochibayashiOctober 3, 2025Oct 2, 2025EN   Remove menu'}]\n",

And yet, \"AI digital health solutions hold the potential to enhance efficiency, reduce costs and improve health outcomes globally,\" says the white paper. Here are seven examples of AI technologies already making a difference in the medical field.AI and healthcare2018201920202021202220232024Year010864212Billions $A Flourish chart]( AI can interpret brain scansA new AI software is \" \" as professionals at examining the brain scans of stroke patients. Two UK universities trained the software on a dataset of 800 brain scans of stroke patients and then trialled it on 2,000 patients.The results were impressive. Alongside the AI model\\\\\\'s accuracy, the software was also able to identify the timescale within which the stroke happened - crucial information for professionals.As Dr Paul Bentley, consultant neurologist, told the _Health Tech Newspaper_: “For the majority of strokes caused by a blood clot, if a patient is within 4.5 hours of the stroke happening, he or she is eligible for both medical and surgical treatments. Up to 6 hours, the patient is also eligible for surgical treatment, but after this time point, deciding whether these treatments might be beneficial becomes tricky, as more cases become irreversible. So it’s essential for doctors to know both the initial onset time, as well as whether a stroke could be reversed.”## AI can spot more bone fractures than humans canSurprisingly, urgent care doctors miss broken bones in up to 10% of cases. What’s more, X-ray technicians are both in short supply and overloaded.So using  could potentially avoid both unnecessary X-rays and missed fractures. The UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says the technology is safe, reliable and could reduce the need for follow-up appointments.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesBut there are concerns around the fast rollout of AI in healthcare.\"It is important that people using these tools are properly trained in doing so, meaning they  from technological limitations ... such as the possibility for wrong information being given,\" Dr Caroline Green of the Institute for Ethics in AI at the University of Oxford told the BBC.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum creating guardrails for Artificial Intelligence?Show moreIn response to the uncertainties surrounding generative AI and the need for robust AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes for all, the Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) has launched the .The Alliance unites industry leaders, governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations to champion responsible global design and release of transparent and inclusive AI systems.This includes the workstreams part of the , in collaboration with the Centre for Energy and Materials, the Centre for Advanced Manufacturing and Supply Chains, the Centre for Cybersecurity, the Centre for Nature and Climate, and the Global Industries team.## Assessing ambulance needs with AIIn the UK, around  are taken by ambulance to hospital each month. It’s down to paramedics to decide who does or doesn’t need to go, and always with an awareness of how few beds are available.A study in Yorkshire in the north of England found that in 80% of cases . The AI model was trained on factors such as a patient’s mobility, pulse and blood oxygen levels and chest pain – it also proved to respond without bias. NICE did caution, however, that before being put into more widespread use, more training was needed.## Detecting early signs of more than 1,000 diseasesA new AI machine learning model can  before the patient is even aware of any symptoms, according to its maker AstraZeneca.Using medical data from 500,000 people who are part of a UK health data repository, the machine could “predict with high confidence a disease diagnosis many years later”.Slavé Petrovski, who led the research, told Sky News: \"For many of these diseases, by the time they manifest clinically and the individual goes to the doctor because of an ailment or visible observation, that is far down the line from when the disease process began.“We can pick up signatures in an individual that are highly predictive of developing , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney disease and many others,\" he said.Another UK study has found that an AI tool can successfully detect . Trained on the MRI scans of over 1,100 adults and children globally, the AI tool was able to spot lesions more quickly than a doctor, but also discover tiny or obscured ones that had evaded the human eye.\" ,\" lead researcher Dr Konrad Wagstyl told the BBC. \"AI can find about two-thirds that doctors miss - but a third are still really difficult to find.\" Combining AI\\\\\\'s findings with human oversight and expertise has the potential to speed up both diagnosis and cure, the researchers say.0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 90%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabledShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?Play/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume↑Decrease Volume↓Seek Forward→Seek Backward←Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemDecrease Caption Size-Increase Caption Size+ or =Seek %0-9Live00:0000:0000:00## Clinical chatbots to guide healthcare decisionsDoctors must make informed, swift medical decisions: AI could potentially speed these up, but it could also provide unreliable or biased information.A US study found that standard large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude or Gemini were unable to provide clinicians with sufficiently relevant or evidence-based answers to their medical questions. But ChatRWD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system – which essentially combines LLMs with retrieval systems to improve output – produced useful answers to  (compared with 2%-10% for the LLMs).Digital interfaces are increasingly being rolled out to help triage patients, too. In an , part of the World Economic Forum’s , a case study on digital patient platform Huma, revealed it could reduce readmission rates by 30%, time spent reviewing patients by up to 40% and “alleviated the workload of healthcare providers”.The report anticipates a future in which technologies like these could “dramatically transform the patient experience. People who are generally healthy can use self-monitoring devices to optimize their mental and physical health, while those with health issues will have access to a wide range of digital solutions”.## AI and traditional medicinePracticed in 170 countries and used by billions of people, traditional medicine has maintained its relevance in the modern world in part because of its emphasis on a holistic approach to healthcare. And while . A new brief from the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, \\\\\\'Mapping the application of artificial intelligence in traditional medicine\\\\\\', shows how  (TCIM) while protecting cultural heritage.India is the first country to launch a , utilizing AI tools to catalogue and analyze indigenous medical texts. The country is also exploring how AI and Ayurgenomics - a field which combines the ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda with modern genomics - can intersect, to see what herbal formulations could help tackle modern diseases.Similarly, , while in South Korea, AI is being used to analyze traditional medicine compounds to treat blood disorders.The global TCIM market is expected to reach nearly $600 billion in 2025 - and AI looks set to accelerate that market further and faster. The new brief stresses the importance of safeguarding  in the process.“AI must not become a new frontier for exploitation,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Systems. “We must ensure that Indigenous Peoples and local communities are not only protected but are active partners in shaping the future of AI in traditional medicine.”##### Have you read?- ##### - ##### - ##### ## AI for healthcare adminAdministrative tasks are both inevitable and time-consuming in the medical field. Using AI co-pilots could free up clinicians to focus more of their time on patients.Microsoft has recently announced its , an AI healthcare tool that can listen to, and create notes on, clinical consultations. And  already has a suite of AI models specifically tailored to alleviate some of the administrative burdens in healthcare. In Germany, an AI platform called  has cut testing and diagnosis times from weeks to hours and its founders are determined to show that the technology \"can be an ally, not an obstacle\". Co-founder Dr Sebastian Casu told EU-Startups: \"No one joins the healthcare sector to spend hours on admin\".Of course, having an AI tool listening in and taking notes on your doctor\\\\\\'s appointment will not appeal to everyone. A recent study in the UK found that just  (although over two-thirds are comfortable with the technology being used to free up professionals\\\\\\' time). Then there is the question of accuracy. A report last year found that OpenAI\\\\\\'s Whisper, used by many hospitals to summarize patient meetings, was .This is why regulation of AI tools is so vital. In the UK, AI-powered medical devices are strictly regulated by the .). In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last year  and concluded that, while the FDA will “continue to play a central role in ensuring safe, effective, and trustworthy AI tools” it was also essential that “all involved entities … attend to AI with the rigour this transformative technology merits”.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookies##### Don\\\\\\'t miss any update on this topicCreate a free account and access your personalized content collection with our latest publications and analyses.License and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.##### Share:!## Forum StoriesnewsletterBringing you weekly curated insights and analysis on the global issues that matter.### More onHealth and Healthcare Systems      Camila Pintarelli and Thomas OxleyOctober 9, 2025Bushra AlBlooshi, Hoda Al Khzaimi and Heba AhmadOctober 8, 2025Hoda Al Khzaimi, Bushra AlBlooshi and Heba AhmadOctober 7, 2025Joan-Paula Bor and Kathleen SchmelerOctober 6, 2025Naoko TochibayashiOctober 3, 2025Oct 2, 2025EN   Remove menu\\'}, {\\'title\\': \\'Advancements in Artificial Intelligence for Medical Computer-Aided ...\\', \\'url\\': \\'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11202700/\\', \\'markdown\\': \"![]( websites use .gov**A**.gov** website belongs to an officialgovernment organization in the United States.![]( .gov websites use HTTPS**A **lock** (LockLocked padlock icon) or ** means you\\'ve safelyconnected to the .gov website.

They found that KARA-CXR significantly outperformed ChatGPT regarding diagnostic accuracy (70.50% vs. 40.50%, according to one observer), false findings, and non-hallucination rate (75% vs. 38%). Both systems showed moderate inter-observer agreement. Their study highlights the superior performance of KARA-CXR in medical imaging diagnostics compared to ChatGPT.Marquez et al. ] focused on using machine learning to differentiate between positive and negative influenza patients in Mexico, where influenza has been a persistent issue since 2009. They used a dataset of 15,480 records from 2010 to 2020, containing clinical and demographic data of patients tested with RT-qPCR. This study evaluated various classification methods and found that Random Forest and Bagging classifiers perform best in terms of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, F1 score, and the AUC. These methods show promise for aiding clinical diagnosis in settings where molecular tests are impractical.Ali et al. ] investigated detecting Parkinson’s disease (PD) using voice attributes from both PD patients and healthy individuals. They employed filter feature selection to remove quasi-constant features and tested several classification models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models, on two datasets. Remarkable results were achieved on Dataset 1, with the Decision Tree and Random Forest methods achieving impressive accuracy. Ensemble learning methods (voting, stacking, and bagging) were applied to further enhance the results, and genetic selection was also tested for accuracy and precision. Their study found higher precision in predicting PD patients and better overall performance when using Dataset 1 compared to Dataset 2.Zakareya et al. ] propose a new deep learning model for breast cancer classification, incorporating features like granular computing and attention mechanisms to achieve enhanced accuracy and reduce the workload of doctors. Their model’s effectiveness is demonstrated by its superior performance compared to other models on two case studies, achieving 93% and 95% accuracy on ultrasound and histopathology images, respectively.Al-rimy et al. ] examined the use of DenseNet169 for knee osteoarthritis detection using X-ray images. An adaptive early-stopping technique with gradual cross-entropy loss estimation is proposed to improve the model’s performance. This approach prevents overfitting and optimizes the number of training epochs. The proposed model demonstrates superior accuracy, precision, recall, and loss compared to existing solutions, indicating the effectiveness of adaptive early stopping and GCE for accurately detecting knee OA.Fatih Uysal ] developed a hybrid artificial intelligence system to detect monkeypox in skin images. An open-source, multi-class image dataset was used, addressing data imbalance through augmentation and preprocessing. State-of-the-art deep learning models were employed for detection, and a unique hybrid model combining high-performing models with LSTM was created. The resulting system achieved 87% test accuracy and a 0.8222 Cohen’s kappa score.Al-Haidari et al. ] propose a new deep learning framework for MR image reconstruction based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) and U-Net. A hybrid spatial and k-space loss function is introduced to improve image quality by minimizing the L1 distance in both spatial and frequency domains. The proposed framework outperformed the traditional SENSE technique and individual U-Net/CGAN models in terms of the PSNR, while maintaining a comparable SSIM. Their CGAN-based framework also showed the best reconstruction performance, proving useful for practical cardiac image reconstruction by providing an enhanced image quality.Bhakar et al. ] reviewed recent computational intelligence-based approaches for identifying disease severity levels. Their study focuses on Parkinson’s disease and diabetic retinopathy, but also briefly covers other diseases. This review examines the methodology, dataset used, and disease type of each approach, evaluating performance metrics such as accuracy and specificity. It also presents public repositories for further research in this field.Alnashwan et al. ] conducted a systematic review to examine the latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and computational intelligence for the detection and treatment of stuttering. They analyzed 14 journal articles from 2019 onward to investigate how AI can accurately determine and classify manifestations of stuttering, as well as how computational intelligence can contribute to developing innovative assessment tools and intervention strategies. Their review highlights the potential of AI and computational intelligence to revolutionize the assessment and treatment of stuttering, enabling personalized and effective approaches for improving the lives of people who have a stutter.## 3. LimitationsAlthough the articles published in this Special Issue present valuable contributions to the field of medical diagnostics leveraging AI and machine learning (ML) techniques, some limitations can be identified across these articles:- (1)Many of these studies have specific focuses or use case scenarios, potentially limiting the generalizability of their findings to broader contexts or populations;- (2)Some articles may have methodological limitations, such as biases in data collection, imbalanced datasets, or reliance on specific classifiers, which could affect the reliability and applicability of their results;- (3)While many studies report impressive results in performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, the evaluation criteria and datasets used may not fully reflect real-world clinical scenarios, leading to potential overestimations of performance;- (4)The interpretation of results may vary across the studies, being potentially influenced by the researchers’ perspectives or biases, which could impact the conclusions drawn from the data.## 4. Future DirectionsMedical image diagnosis powered by artificial intelligence (AI) represents the cutting edge of improvements in healthcare. We should continually strive to enhance the health and wellbeing of our community by providing smart solutions that benefit both patients and physicians. AI technology has significantly advanced medical image diagnosis, improving accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility in healthcare scenarios. AI algorithms can analyze X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, and patient records, such as those of patients with coronary stenosis or Parkinson’s disease, to detect abnormalities such as tumors, fractures, and infections. For example, AI can identify early-stage cancers that might be missed by the human eye. AI can interpret echocardiograms (ECGs) and cardiac MRI scans to detect heart conditions like arrhythmias, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. In light of this, this Special Issue highlights and disseminates the latest breakthroughs in AI-driven diagnostic technologies, with the aim of showcasing innovative research, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and exploring the transformative impact of AI on medical imaging and diagnosis. By bringing together contributions from leading experts, we hope to advance this field of research, improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, and ultimately enhance patient care and health outcomes.The recent rise of large language models (LLMs) like Gemini and medGemini , ] or ChatGPT and BiomedGPT ] presents a transformative opportunity for the healthcare industry, particularly in the realm of diagnosis. These powerful tools can significantly enhance existing diagnostic systems by providing more insightful explanations, ultimately leading to more accurate and efficient patient care. One key contribution of LLMs lies in their ability to generate detailed textual reports. By analyzing vast amounts of medical data, including patient history, test results, and relevant research, LLMs can produce comprehensive reports that not only outline a diagnosis but also explain the reasoning behind it. This detailed explanation assists healthcare professionals by offering a transparent and step-by-step breakdown of how the LLM arrived at its conclusions, fostering trust in the system and allowing doctors to leverage the LLM’s insights while incorporating their own medical expertise. While LLMs cannot directly generate heat maps (i.e., saliency maps) for medical images, they can play a significant role in the process. When integrated with computer vision models, LLMs are able to analyze medical images (X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, etc.), and they can be trained to detect and extract relevant features, anomalies, and patterns from these images. Through this, LLMs have the ability to generate textual descriptions of these highlighted areas that explain why they are important for a certain diagnosis. This provides a form of visual explanation alongside the LLM’s textual report. The combined power of detailed textual explanations and visual heat maps can empower healthcare professionals in several ways:- (1)It improves diagnostic accuracy by offering a comprehensive understanding of the LLM’s reasoning;- (2)It facilitates communication with patients by providing clear and accessible explanations of the diagnostic process , ];- (3)It fosters collaboration between humans and machines, allowing medical professionals to leverage the strengths of LLMs while retaining their own irreplaceable role in healthcare decision making ].However, it is crucial to acknowledge that LLMs are still under development, and their integration into healthcare systems requires careful consideration. Ensuring data privacy and security is paramount, and ongoing human oversight remains essential. In conclusion, LLM-based tools like Gemini and GPTs (Generative Pre-Trained Transformers) hold immense potential to revolutionize healthcare diagnostics. As mentioned above, the detailed textual explanations and visual heat maps provided by these tools can empower healthcare professionals by allowing them gain a deeper understanding of the diagnostic process, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency in patient care. As LLM technology continues to evolve, the future of healthcare diagnosis promises to be one of increased transparency, collaboration, and, ultimately, improved patient outcomes. The development of robust medical XAI models is often hindered by the limited availability of labeled datasets, particularly for rare diseases or specific imaging modalities. Generative AI techniques ] offer promising solutions to address this challenge, enabling the creation of synthetic medical data across various modalities—text, images, signals, etc. LLMs like GPT-3 excel at generating synthetic patient records that closely mimic the structure, terminology, and statistical distributions of real clinical notes. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have revolutionized medical image synthesis, producing realistic X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans that can incorporate specific anatomical variations or pathologies. This not only increases the size of datasets but allows researchers to simulate diverse disease presentations. Additionally, GANs can augment datasets by introducing realistic variations to existing images or even by translating images between modalities (e.g., generating a potential CT scan from an MRI scan), reducing the reliance on acquiring data in multiple ways. Generative models are able to synthesize physiological signals like ECGs, EEGs, and others, replicating real-world patterns and anomalies. This can be leveraged to expand training data for diagnostic models and facilitate the development of monitoring devices. Furthermore, generative AI can create hybrid signals with controlled variations, simulating complex or unusual health conditions to diversify training data.Finally, we can potentially leverage contrastive learning ] to address the challenge of data-labeling exhaustion in the development of LLM-based tools similar to medGemini or BiomedGPT. Contrastive learning is a technique within self-supervised learning where a machine learning model learns by creating its own supervisory signals from unlabeled data. The primary goal of this is to train a model to recognize similarities and differences between data samples: the model learns an embedding space (a kind of representational map) where similar items are clustered together and dissimilar items are far apart. Meanwhile, deep active learning could prove to be capable of supporting and automating the process of labeling medical data.## 5. ConclusionsIn conclusion, this Special Issue underscores the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in medical diagnostics, as evidenced by the collection of cutting-edge research it presents. While these advancements offer unprecedented accuracy and efficiency in disease detection and treatment planning across various medical fields, including radiology, pathology, genomics, and personalized medicine, several limitations persist. These limitations include the potential lack of generalizability, methodological constraints, and the need for the careful interpretation of results. Looking ahead, the integration of large language models (LLMs) like Gemini and medGemini holds promise for further revolutionizing healthcare diagnosis through empowering healthcare professionals with detailed textual explanations and visual heat maps to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis. Despite these advancements, however, ongoing considerations for data privacy, security, and human oversight are essential. Ultimately, the future of healthcare diagnosis promises increased transparency, collaboration, and improved patient outcomes as AI technology continues to evolve and move forward to address current challenges.## AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) for providing support by means of a wide range of research grants from the Korean government (MSIT) (No. RS-2022-00166402 and RS-2023-00256517) for improving AI-based medical diagnostics.

And yet, \"AI digital health solutions hold the potential to enhance efficiency, reduce costs and improve health outcomes globally,\" says the white paper. Here are seven examples of AI technologies already making a difference in the medical field.AI and healthcare2018201920202021202220232024Year010864212Billions $A Flourish chart]( AI can interpret brain scansA new AI software is \" \" as professionals at examining the brain scans of stroke patients. Two UK universities trained the software on a dataset of 800 brain scans of stroke patients and then trialled it on 2,000 patients.The results were impressive. Alongside the AI model\\\\\\'s accuracy, the software was also able to identify the timescale within which the stroke happened - crucial information for professionals.As Dr Paul Bentley, consultant neurologist, told the _Health Tech Newspaper_: “For the majority of strokes caused by a blood clot, if a patient is within 4.5 hours of the stroke happening, he or she is eligible for both medical and surgical treatments. Up to 6 hours, the patient is also eligible for surgical treatment, but after this time point, deciding whether these treatments might be beneficial becomes tricky, as more cases become irreversible. So it’s essential for doctors to know both the initial onset time, as well as whether a stroke could be reversed.”## AI can spot more bone fractures than humans canSurprisingly, urgent care doctors miss broken bones in up to 10% of cases. What’s more, X-ray technicians are both in short supply and overloaded.So using  could potentially avoid both unnecessary X-rays and missed fractures. The UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says the technology is safe, reliable and could reduce the need for follow-up appointments.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesBut there are concerns around the fast rollout of AI in healthcare.\"It is important that people using these tools are properly trained in doing so, meaning they  from technological limitations ... such as the possibility for wrong information being given,\" Dr Caroline Green of the Institute for Ethics in AI at the University of Oxford told the BBC.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum creating guardrails for Artificial Intelligence?Show moreIn response to the uncertainties surrounding generative AI and the need for robust AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes for all, the Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) has launched the .The Alliance unites industry leaders, governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations to champion responsible global design and release of transparent and inclusive AI systems.This includes the workstreams part of the , in collaboration with the Centre for Energy and Materials, the Centre for Advanced Manufacturing and Supply Chains, the Centre for Cybersecurity, the Centre for Nature and Climate, and the Global Industries team.## Assessing ambulance needs with AIIn the UK, around  are taken by ambulance to hospital each month. It’s down to paramedics to decide who does or doesn’t need to go, and always with an awareness of how few beds are available.A study in Yorkshire in the north of England found that in 80% of cases . The AI model was trained on factors such as a patient’s mobility, pulse and blood oxygen levels and chest pain – it also proved to respond without bias. NICE did caution, however, that before being put into more widespread use, more training was needed.## Detecting early signs of more than 1,000 diseasesA new AI machine learning model can  before the patient is even aware of any symptoms, according to its maker AstraZeneca.Using medical data from 500,000 people who are part of a UK health data repository, the machine could “predict with high confidence a disease diagnosis many years later”.Slavé Petrovski, who led the research, told Sky News: \"For many of these diseases, by the time they manifest clinically and the individual goes to the doctor because of an ailment or visible observation, that is far down the line from when the disease process began.“We can pick up signatures in an individual that are highly predictive of developing , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney disease and many others,\" he said.Another UK study has found that an AI tool can successfully detect .

But ChatRWD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system – which essentially combines LLMs with retrieval systems to improve output – produced useful answers to  (compared with 2%-10% for the LLMs).Digital interfaces are increasingly being rolled out to help triage patients, too. In an , part of the World Economic Forum’s , a case study on digital patient platform Huma, revealed it could reduce readmission rates by 30%, time spent reviewing patients by up to 40% and “alleviated the workload of healthcare providers”.The report anticipates a future in which technologies like these could “dramatically transform the patient experience. People who are generally healthy can use self-monitoring devices to optimize their mental and physical health, while those with health issues will have access to a wide range of digital solutions”.## AI and traditional medicinePracticed in 170 countries and used by billions of people, traditional medicine has maintained its relevance in the modern world in part because of its emphasis on a holistic approach to healthcare. And while . A new brief from the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, \\\\\\'Mapping the application of artificial intelligence in traditional medicine\\\\\\', shows how  (TCIM) while protecting cultural heritage.India is the first country to launch a , utilizing AI tools to catalogue and analyze indigenous medical texts. The country is also exploring how AI and Ayurgenomics - a field which combines the ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda with modern genomics - can intersect, to see what herbal formulations could help tackle modern diseases.Similarly, , while in South Korea, AI is being used to analyze traditional medicine compounds to treat blood disorders.The global TCIM market is expected to reach nearly $600 billion in 2025 - and AI looks set to accelerate that market further and faster. The new brief stresses the importance of safeguarding  in the process.“AI must not become a new frontier for exploitation,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Systems. “We must ensure that Indigenous Peoples and local communities are not only protected but are active partners in shaping the future of AI in traditional medicine.”##### Have you read?- ##### - ##### - ##### ## AI for healthcare adminAdministrative tasks are both inevitable and time-consuming in the medical field. Using AI co-pilots could free up clinicians to focus more of their time on patients.Microsoft has recently announced its , an AI healthcare tool that can listen to, and create notes on, clinical consultations. And  already has a suite of AI models specifically tailored to alleviate some of the administrative burdens in healthcare. In Germany, an AI platform called  has cut testing and diagnosis times from weeks to hours and its founders are determined to show that the technology \"can be an ally, not an obstacle\". Co-founder Dr Sebastian Casu told EU-Startups: \"No one joins the healthcare sector to spend hours on admin\".Of course, having an AI tool listening in and taking notes on your doctor\\\\\\'s appointment will not appeal to everyone. A recent study in the UK found that just  (although over two-thirds are comfortable with the technology being used to free up professionals\\\\\\' time). Then there is the question of accuracy. A report last year found that OpenAI\\\\\\'s Whisper, used by many hospitals to summarize patient meetings, was .This is why regulation of AI tools is so vital. In the UK, AI-powered medical devices are strictly regulated by the .). In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last year  and concluded that, while the FDA will “continue to play a central role in ensuring safe, effective, and trustworthy AI tools” it was also essential that “all involved entities … attend to AI with the rigour this transformative technology merits”.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookies##### Don\\\\\\'t miss any update on this topicCreate a free account and access your personalized content collection with our latest publications and analyses.License and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.##### Share:!## Forum StoriesnewsletterBringing you weekly curated insights and analysis on the global issues that matter.### More onHealth and Healthcare Systems      Camila Pintarelli and Thomas OxleyOctober 9, 2025Bushra AlBlooshi, Hoda Al Khzaimi and Heba AhmadOctober 8, 2025Hoda Al Khzaimi, Bushra AlBlooshi and Heba AhmadOctober 7, 2025Joan-Paula Bor and Kathleen SchmelerOctober 6, 2025Naoko TochibayashiOctober 3, 2025Oct 2, 2025EN   Remove menu\\'}, {\\'title\\': \\'Improving Patient Care and Safety With AI - Healthcare Executive\\', \\'url\\': \\'https://www.healthcareexecutive.org/archives/march-april-2024/improving-patient-care--and-safety-with-ai\\', \\'markdown\\': \\'By Topic: TechnologyInformation ManagementSafety QualityBy Collection: Safety![]( intelligence has demonstrated that it can improve patient care and safety by helping clinicians analyze imaging and pathology reports.\\\\xa0Many applications, though, are still in the early stages of development and adoption, especially in the automation of administrative tasks.“For quality care, I believe AI allows us to augment clinical decision-making,” says Sachin Shah, MD, an associate professor of medicine and pediatrics and chief medical information officer at UChicago Medicine in Chicago. He notes there is a sizable predictive analytics and machine learning space that can significantly leverage the large amount of data available. As a result, “we can better identify patterns, predict health issues and customize treatment plans,” Shah says.Achieving that level of precision and personalization at the patient level will help improve outcomes and streamline many care-delivery processes, according to Shah.Patient safety is also enhanced by AI’s capacity to analyze vast volumes of data in real time. “This can lead to early detection of clinical deterioration, intervention ahead of potential adverse drug reactions and an overall reduction of medical errors,” Shah says. “Clinicians are alerted sooner that something may be trending in the wrong direction, well before it may become clinically evident.”### AI’s PotentialRichard Greenhill, DHA, CPHQ, FACHE, director of the undergraduate healthcare management program in the School of Health Professions at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, says high-quality healthcare depends on reliable and accurate processes in the delivery of patient care “to ensure that safety is prioritized for sustainable outcomes. Process variation is the enemy of quality, so the tools of AI are exciting because they can undertake some of the more routine and repeatable processes that are susceptible to the impact of human factors.”The TTUHSC Institute of Telehealth and Digital Innovation was established in September 2023 to create a digital health ecosystem, where technologies such as AI transform care delivery in West Texas. “AI has the potential to unleash new ways of approaching performance improvement and patient safety as we begin to tap into the universe of data that encompasses health—both inside and outside of the delivery system,” says Greenhill.Systems thinking is also an important component of quality care. “Systems thinking in care delivery helps us focus on interrelationships in processes to solve complex problems in our quality improvement strategy,” Greenhill explains. “This is why we should not ever first blame people when a medical mistake or undesired event occurs. A system produces the results for which it was designed. Thus, a person or a tool, such as AI in our delivery system, can never itself be the focus when an error occurs.”Healthcare facilities must look deeply at the design\\\\xa0of how these resources were planned for and supported in their activities, according to Greenhill. AI allows\\\\xa0“us to look across interprofessional processes and aggregate datasets to discover insights that we may not\\\\xa0have assumed.” Examples include early detection via analysis of diagnostic studies, such as radiology and clinical lab, and more quickly identifying high-risk patients based on treatment and disease progression. “AI can assist quality professionals, clinicians and\\\\xa0leaders to make sense of the complexities in our systems in managing risks associated with handoffs,\\\\xa0care coordination and treatment interventions,” Greenhill says.AI can enhance patient care in everything from ophthalmology to cardiology and pathology/oncology to psychiatry, according to Thomas Fuchs, DrSc, dean of the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine in New York City. “AI should help physicians to be faster and more effective, do new things they currently cannot do and reduce burnout,” he says.Even before the AI department was established in the fall of 2021, Mount Sinai was testing AI systems in the ICU to alert nurses to patient risk of malnutrition, deterioration or fall, along with reducing false alarms and staff overhead. The AI system takes information from the EHR and various devices in the ICU.Cancer detection. AI has also benefited pathology at Mount Sinai by detecting cancer and grading cancer earlier than before. The institution has developed an AI foundation model based on 3 billion images from 400,000 digital microscopy slides of cancer biopsies and resections. “The model can detect biomarkers to predict what cancer treatment will work for a specific patient,” Fuchs says.Diagnostic imaging assisted by AI holds promise, as well. A retrospective study published online in European Radiology in March 2023 concluded that among more than 1,200 breast cancer cases in Norway, an AI system scored 93% of the screen-detected cancers and 40% of the interval cancers with an AI score of 10 (on a scale of 1 to 10, based on the risk of malignancy). Furthermore, the AI system scored all screen-detected cancers and nearly 50% of interval cancers in women with the highest breast density with an AI score of 10. This resulted in a sensitivity of 80.9% for women with the highest breast density for the AI system, compared to 62.8% for independent double reading by radiologists.Roughly 40% of the screen-detected cancers achieved an AI score of 10 on the prior mammograms, indicating a potential for earlier detection by using AI in screen-reading.Physicians at the Breast Center at Mount Sinai Medical Center believe that the use of AI for detecting new abnormalities in mammograms and MRI scans is promising. They also predict that AI will help radiologists interpret mammograms while reducing the number of false positive interpretations, thus avoiding unnecessary biopsies. However, further research is needed to ensure the technology’s reliability and the anticipated benefits.Informatics. Excitement about the potential for AI led the University of Kentucky to form a multidisciplinary collaborative of physicians, data scientists, biomedical engineers and others to form the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Alliance. After two years of success in starting projects around radiology, pharmacy and cancer, the alliance merged in 2022 with an innovations program to form the Center for Applied AI within biomedical informatics for even broader AI applications across healthcare and the university. Most AI healthcare initiatives at the university hospital stem from a desire to improve quality of care and reporting, such as better implementing the recommendation from the Society of Thoracic Surgery that a patient take a beta-blocker within 24 hours of surgery. Using tools already developed or in development in one discipline allows center members to more quickly apply solutions to other projects.A chatbot is being developed at the college that will connect with patients preparing to undergo cardiac surgery. The chatbot would help guide patients on when to take their medicine and help answer questions they may have about the surgery.Over the past year, there has been a rapid increase in the optimization of administrative tasks completed via AI, including documentation, prior authorizations and revenue cycling. “We are also able to better communicate with our patients and give our patients more self-efficacy,” Shah of UChicago Medicine says. “Conversational AI is very well suited to replace many of the burdensome nonclinical tasks that do not require clinical judgement.AI offers an opportunity to enhance quality care by augmenting clinical decision-making, according to Shah. “Through predictive analytics and machine learning, we can leverage vast amounts of data to identify patterns, predict potential health issues and customize treatment plans for individual patients. This personalization can significantly improve outcomes and streamline care delivery processes.”Similarly, AI’s role in patient safety “lies in its ability to analyze data in real time, allowing for early detection of potential risks such as adverse drug interactions or deteriorating patient condition,” Shah says. AI-powered systems can also assist in proactive interventions, thus reducing medical errors and ensuring timely and accurate care, all of which ultimately safeguard patient well-being.UChicago Medicine is scheduled to begin a pilot study this spring comprising 250 of its physicians to leverage generative AI to streamline and take over much of the clinical documentation.Some EHR providers include AI algorithms in their products, according to Greenhill. “These tools show promise to augment and enhance work for clinicians,” he says. “However, as these tools become more widely used, we need to maintain vigilance about the risk that they pose to patients and processes due to model and data bias.”AI chatbots—automated software applications—can perform many mundane tasks and reduce the burden on staff, physicians and nurses so they can pursue “the meaningful work they signed up to do, such as physicians spending more time with patients,” Greenhill says.“If a human does the same task 10 times every hour,\\\\xa0he or she is more likely to make a mistake due to a\\\\xa0host of human factors,” Greenhill says. By contrast,\\\\xa0AI chatbots can operate nonstop, requiring neither breaks nor rest. “This is a win in the war on process variation,” he says.Surgical care. Danielle Walsh, MD, FAAP, FACS, a professor of surgery and vice chair of Surgery for Quality and Process Improvement at the University\\\\xa0of Kentucky College of Medicine in Lexington, was part of a panel of surgeons who discussed the impact\\\\xa0of AI on surgical practices at the American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress 2023 in October. By allowing AI to take over many of the repetitive and rote administrative tasks that burden physicians, “the physician can perform more cognitive decision-making and focus more on human connections and time spent with patients,” says Walsh.AI will also play a major role in mandatory reporting of quality metrics to governmental and other entities, according to Walsh, freeing up even more staff members to perform more substantial work to truly improve quality of care. A study published online in JAMA Network in June 2023 on resources spent on just measuring and reporting data on 162 unique quality metrics found that an estimated 108,478 person-hours with a personnel cost of $5 million and another $603,000 in vendor fees were required. “Those funds are better spent on interventions than reporting,” Walsh says.AI tools also can communicate with a patient at home to ensure drug adherence, collect feedback on how patients are feeling, and use that feedback to become more connected with the patient in between visits or after discharge from the hospital. “And if you add in digital sensors, we can do tremendous monitoring at home,” Walsh says. “During COVID, people at home were at ICU-level care.”A patient with a blood vessel bypassed in the leg, for example, could wear a sock with a sensor at home to detect if blood flow begins to decrease before the blood vessel blocks off again and before the patient develops a blue, painful foot. “AI combined with sensors will allow us to intervene earlier and prevent more serious complications,” Walsh says.### Looking ForwardAs for AI cost, some healthcare facilities already have 5G network capability, along with modern wiring and systems that are compatible with AI, while others will need to invest in infrastructure improvements. “There will also be tradeoffs,” Walsh says. “Because AI requires a tremendous amount of computing power, you are not going to be able to run every AI algorithm simultaneously. And as the area grows, you will need to prioritize AI systems that meet the needs of a specific institution and the specific patient population being served.”Which areas of AI to pursue differ by organization and their culture, according to Shah, and are determined by staffing and the ability of teams and leadership to adjust. “There is not necessarily a lot of replacement of human expertise coming, but certainly a lot of reallocating human resources to different work that is ideally more top-of-license work, by automating some of the repetitive administrative tasks and algorithmic work,” he says.However, the quality of the output from AI is contingent on the quality of data entered, “so you need to invest a lot into your data infrastructure,” Shah says. “The quality of your data needs to be high.”There are also ethical considerations. “There has to be clear transparency around the decision-making in these models,” Shah says. “The concept of algorithmic bias is really important to understand and to ensure we are minimizing. Humans need to be at the center to carefully scrutinize any potential bias by closely monitoring the inputs, the algorithms and outputs to ensure they are not leading to unintended consequences.”_Bob Kronemyer is a freelance writer based in Elkhart, Ind._### Acceptance and Implementation StrategiesDanielle Walsh, MD, FAAP, FACS, a professor of surgery and vice chair of Surgery for Quality and Process Improvement at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine in Lexington, believes there are two big myths about using AI in healthcare: that physicians don’t want AI and that patients don’t want AI.****\\'}]', name='web_search_tool', call_id='call_VMsXcnyqQcMvApHu6L6AaZb3', is_error=False), FunctionExecutionResult(content='[{\\'title\\': \\'AI in Healthcare Statistics: Market Insights & Growth - Binariks\\', \\'url\\': \\'https://binariks.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-ai-healthcare-market/\\', \\'markdown\\': \\'- ![]( ![]( ![]( AI in Healthcare Statistics: Market Insights & GrowthUpdated Jun 26, 2025 · 9 min readHealthcareData Science and AI/MLAI DevelopmentContent      !Artificial Intelligence has a great demand in the healthcare industry.

However, accuracy significantly decreased by 11.3% when clinicians were shown systematically biased AI model predictions and model explanations did not mitigate the negative effects of such predictions.### MeaningAI model explanations did not help clinicians recognize systematically biased AI models.## Abstract### ImportanceArtificial intelligence (AI) could support clinicians when diagnosing hospitalized patients; however, systematic bias in AI models could worsen clinician diagnostic accuracy. Recent regulatory guidance has called for AI models to include explanations to mitigate errors made by models, but the effectiveness of this strategy has not been established.### ObjectivesTo evaluate the impact of systematically biased AI on clinician diagnostic accuracy and to determine if image-based AI model explanations can mitigate model errors.### Design, Setting, and ParticipantsRandomized clinical vignette survey study administered between April 2022 and January 2023 across 13 US states involving hospitalist physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants.### InterventionsClinicians were shown 9 clinical vignettes of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory failure, including their presenting symptoms, physical examination, laboratory results, and chest radiographs. Clinicians were then asked to determine the likelihood of pneumonia, heart failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as the underlying cause(s) of each patient’s acute respiratory failure. To establish baseline diagnostic accuracy, clinicians were shown 2 vignettes without AI model input. Clinicians were then randomized to see 6 vignettes with AI model input with or without AI model explanations. Among these 6 vignettes, 3 vignettes included standard-model predictions, and 3 vignettes included systematically biased model predictions.### Main Outcomes and MeasuresClinician diagnostic accuracy for pneumonia, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.### ResultsMedian participant age was 34 years (IQR, 31-39) and 241 (57.7%) were female. Four hundred fifty-seven clinicians were randomized and completed at least 1 vignette, with 231 randomized to AI model predictions without explanations, and 226 randomized to AI model predictions with explanations. Clinicians’ baseline diagnostic accuracy was 73.0% (95% CI, 68.3% to 77.8%) for the 3 diagnoses. When shown a standard AI model without explanations, clinician accuracy increased over baseline by 2.9 percentage points (95% CI, 0.5 to 5.2) and by 4.4 percentage points (95% CI, 2.0 to 6.9) when clinicians were also shown AI model explanations. Systematically biased AI model predictions decreased clinician accuracy by 11.3 percentage points (95% CI, 7.2 to 15.5) compared with baseline and providing biased AI model predictions with explanations decreased clinician accuracy by 9.1 percentage points (95% CI, 4.9 to 13.2) compared with baseline, representing a nonsignificant improvement of 2.3 percentage points (95% CI, −2.7 to 7.2) compared with the systematically biased AI model.### Conclusions and RelevanceAlthough standard AI models improve diagnostic accuracy, systematically biased AI models reduced diagnostic accuracy, and commonly used image-based AI model explanations did not mitigate this harmful effect.### Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: * * *This randomized clinical vignette study examines whether providing AI explanations to biased AI models enhances clinician diagnostic accuracy.## IntroductionArtificial intelligence (AI) shows promise in identifying abnormalities in clinical images, such as pneumonia from chest radiographs, diabetic retinopathy from fundus images, or skin cancer from histopathology images., , ,  AI models in clinical care analyze patient data, identify patterns, and make predictions. Integrating AI into clinical decision-making may result in higher accuracy than a clinician without AI. However, systematically biased AI models (ie, models that consistently misdiagnose patient subpopulations) can lead to errors and potential harm., ,  For example, an AI model trained on data in which female patients are consistently underdiagnosed for heart disease may learn this bias and underdiagnose females if deployed. Physician performance can be harmed by following incorrect predictions, a phenomenon known as _overreliance_. Ideally, clinicians would be able to follow AI predictions when correct but ignore incorrect AI predictions. However, the extent to which AI can be safely integrated to support diagnostic decisions is still largely unknown.Recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance highlights the importance of providing clinicians with the ability to independently review the basis for software recommendations, including the information and logic used in a model’s decisions. Although AI developers frequently use AI explanations to debug models during development, providing similar explanations to clinicians, as recommended by the FDA, could potentially enhance interpretability after deployment. Explanations could help clinicians better understand a model’s logic before acting on its recommendation, helping to mitigate errors made by systematically biased models. For example, image-based explanations designed to highlight important regions of an image that were used in an AI model’s decision could help clinicians identify when models are behaving inaccurately.To determine if providing AI explanations could enhance clinician diagnostic accuracy and alleviate the negative impact of systematically biased models, we conducted a randomized clinical vignette web-based survey study. We focused on the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure as a test case for this broader challenge because acute respiratory failure is commonly encountered in practice, often misdiagnosed, and evaluated using commonly encountered data such as chest radiographs that AI tools can analyze. We presented participants with standard and systematically biased AI, randomizing participants to see AI predictions alone or AI predictions with explanations. This design allowed us to test our hypothesis that systematically biased models would harm clinician diagnostic accuracy, but commonly used image-based explanations would help clinicians partially recover their performance.## Methods### ParticipantsWe recruited hospitalist physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants who commonly care for patients with acute respiratory failure to complete the study. The study protocol is available in  and the statistical analysis plan in . We first identified 12 hospitalist leaders as site champions through interaction with the Society of Hospital Medicine research committee and the authors’ personal contacts. Site champions advertised the study via email to their local hospital medicine divisions. Each site champion sent a follow-up reminder email after 2 weeks. Interested participants were directed to the study landing page, which confirmed study eligibility, provided additional study information, study instructions, and obtained informed consent prior to randomization (see the study protocol in  and eFigure 1 in ). Participants were offered a $50 gift card for completing the study.This study was deemed exempt by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. Although the study was not registered initially given its vignette-based design, to ensure it was appropriately reflected in the trial literature, it was registered on ClinicialTrials.gov after its completion with the registration parameters based on the prespecified protocol.### Clinical VignettesWe created 45 clinical vignettes based on patients hospitalized with acute respiratory failure in 2017 at the University of Michigan. Patients were selected to achieve study goals while being representative of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory failure (see eMethods in ). A study team member reviewed each patient’s chart to create a succinct version of the patient’s presenting history, past medical history, current medications, physical examination findings, laboratory findings, and chest radiograph for each vignette (eFigure 2 in ). At least 4 pulmonary physicians independently reviewed each patient’s complete medical record to determine if pneumonia, heart failure, and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was the patient’s underlying diagnosis.Each vignette had 3 reference diagnostic labels pertaining to pneumonia, heart failure, and COPD based on the average of these reviews, and each reference label was binary, indicating whether the disease was present or absent. See eTable 1 in  for patient characteristics for additional details.### Study DesignThe survey was conducted using a Qualtrics survey tool. Participants were assigned 9 of 45 clinical vignettes to review. All participants followed the same vignette order: 2 vignettes without AI predictions, 6 vignettes with AI predictions, and 1 vignette with a clinical consultation by a hypothetical colleague ( ). Upon study initiation, all participants were randomized to AI predictions with or without AI explanations for all 6 AI vignettes, and all participants were also randomized to see 1 of 3 types of systematically biased AI models during 3 of the 6 AI vignettes.#### Figure 1. Randomization and Study Flow Diagram for the 9 Clinical Vignettes.]( in a new tab]( completing informed consent, participants were randomized to artificial intelligence (AI) predictions with or without explanations and all participants were also randomized to 1 of 3 types of systematically biased AI models during a subset of vignettes in the study. The 3 systematically biased AI models included a model predicting pneumonia if aged 80 years or older, a model predicting heart failure if body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 30 or higher, and a model predicting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) if a blur was applied to the radiograph. Participants were first shown 2 vignettes without AI predictions to measure baseline diagnostic accuracy. The next 6 vignettes included AI predictions. If the participant was randomized to see AI explanations, the participant was also shown an AI model explanation with the AI predictions. Three vignettes had standard AI predictions, and 3 had biased AI predictions shown in random order. The final vignette included a clinical consultation, a short narrative provided by a hypothetical trusted colleague who identified the correct diagnosis and their diagnostic rationale.The first 2 vignettes did not include AI predictions and were used to measure baseline diagnostic accuracy. The next 6 vignettes included AI predictions immediately after the patient case. If randomized to see AI explanations, the participant was also shown an image-based AI model explanation alongside the AI predictions. Three vignettes had standard AI predictions and 3 had biased predictions shown in random order. The final vignette included a clinical consultation, a short narrative provided by a hypothetical trusted colleague describing the rationale behind the most likely diagnosis and recommended treatments. By design, the clinical consultation vignette always recommended the correct diagnosis and treatment, serving as a realistic upper bound of participant diagnostic accuracy when provided accurate recommendations.After each vignette, participants were asked to separately assess how likely pneumonia, heart failure, or COPD was contributing to the patient’s respiratory failure on a scale of 0 to 100 (eFigure 3 in ). Responses were collected on a continuous scale to calculate the correlation between AI model scores and participant responses. In calculating accuracy, responses of 50 or higher were considered positive for the diagnosis. Patients could have 1, more than 1, or none of the conditions. After completing the diagnostic assessment, participants were asked whether they would administer any combination of steroids, antibiotics, intravenous (IV) diuretics, or none of these treatments to the patient.### Standard and Systematically Biased AI Model Predictions and ExplanationsWhen participants were shown AI predictions, the model provided a score for each diagnosis on a scale of 0 to 100 estimating how likely the patient’s symptoms were due to pneumonia, heart failure, and COPD ( ). Standard AI predictions were generated using a machine learning model trained using standard approaches on a separate data set. All participants were randomized to see 1 of 3 systematically biased AI models: (1) a model predicting a high likelihood of pneumonia for a patient who was 80 years or older; (2) a model predicting a high likelihood of heart failure if a patient’s body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 30 or higher; and (3) a model predicting a high likelihood of COPD if a blur was applied to the radiograph (eMethods in ). Vignettes with biased models were shown for patients with attributes leading the biased model to predict the diagnosis with high likelihood. For example, a participant randomized to see the model biased for age was shown vignettes of patients 80 years or older with the biased model, and the model displayed a high likelihood prediction for pneumonia and standard predictions for the 2 other diagnoses.#### Figure 2. Examples of Model Predictions and Explanations for Standard and Systematically Biased AI Models for Patients.!Patient 1 is an 81-year-old male with respiratory failure from heart failure. A, The standard AI model correctly diagnosed heart failure as the cause of acute respiratory failure and provided an explanation highlighting areas in the chest radiograph used to make the prediction. B, The systematically biased AI model incorrectly diagnosed pneumonia as the cause of acute respiratory failure due to the patient’s age and provided an explanation highlighting irrelevant features in the chest radiograph. Standard-model predictions for heart failure (the correct diagnosis) are also provided.Patient 2 is an 88-year-old female with respiratory failure from COPD. C, The standard AI model incorrectly diagnosed pneumonia and correctly diagnosed COPD as the cause of respiratory failure and provided reasonable explanations. D, The biased AI model incorrectly diagnosed pneumonia as the cause of respiratory failure due to patient age and provided an explanation highlighting irrelevant features in the chest radiograph. Standard-model predictions for COPD (the correct diagnosis) are also provided.For participants randomized to explanations, explanations were presented when the AI model provided a score of 50 or higher (corresponding to positive diagnosis). Explanations were shown as Grad-CAM heatmaps overlaid on the chest radiograph that highlighted which regions of the image most affecting the model’s prediction ( ). Explanations generated from the standard model highlighted clinically meaningful regions on the chest radiograph (eg, lungs). Explanations associated with the systematically biased models highlighted areas of the radiograph corresponding to age, BMI, or preprocessing (eg, low bone density, soft tissue; ; and see eMethods in  3 for details of how biased model explanations were generated). Because the biased models always made positive predictions, participants randomized to explanations were always shown explanations with biased predictions. In contrast, when shown standard-model predictions, explanations were shown with 17 pneumonia predictions (38%) , 18 heart failure predictions (40%), and 9 COPD predictions (20%).By design, the standard model had an overall accuracy of 75% and the biased models had overall accuracy of 70% (eTable 2 in ), which is on par with physicians and reflects the difficulty of the diagnostic tasks. Therefore, such models would likely meet specifications by regulators for approval. However, among the subset of patients for whom the biased models made biased predictions, the biased models were 33% accurate, whereas the standard model was 67% accurate.### Participant DemographicsAfter completing the vignettes, participant demographic information, including self-reported gender, race, and ethnicity, was collected to assess sample diversity and representativeness. Participants were also asked about AI knowledge (see eMethods for the postsurvey questions in ).### Study OutcomesThe primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy between vignette settings, defined as the number of correct diagnostic assessments over the total number of assessments. Participants made 3 separate assessments in each vignette, 1 for each diagnosis. If the participant’s assessment agreed with the reference label, the diagnostic assessment was correct. Overall accuracy was calculated using assessments for all diagnoses. Accuracy for a specific diagnosis was calculated using assessments relevant to the specific diagnosis.In vignettes with biased model predictions, the biased model provided a prediction for the diagnosis for which it was biased and standard predictions for the 2 other diagnoses. Although participants made 3 diagnostic assessments in those vignettes, only diagnostic assessments corresponding to the biased predictions were included in the accuracy calculation.Secondary outcomes included treatment selection accuracy, correlation between participants’ diagnostic assessment scores and model scores, and confusion matrices across vignette settings.### Statistical AnalysisThe primary preplanned analysis compared diagnostic accuracy between the clinician baseline and each AI model vignette setting. This analysis sought to specifically determine (1) whether standard AI improved clinician accuracy, (2) whether standard AI with explanations improved accuracy, (3) whether biased AI hurt diagnostic accuracy, and (4) whether biased AI with explanations helped clinicians recover from the biased predictions.Completed vignettes were included in the analysis regardless of whether a participant completed all 9 vignettes. Diagnostic accuracy across vignette settings was compared by fitting a cross-classified, generalized, random-effects model, in which individual diagnostic assessments were nested within study participants and patients. The outcome was a binary variable indicating whether the diagnostic assessment was correct and the exposure was the specific vignette setting for which the assessment was performed. Predictive margins and contrasts were calculated to estimate accuracy at each vignette setting, and differences between settings, with 95% CIs were calculated using the delta method.Exploratory subgroup analyses were also conducted by specific diagnosis, clinician profession, and participant’s prior interactions with clinical decision support. A secondary analysis was conducted to understand the effect of correct and incorrect model predictions on treatment selection accuracy.We aimed to recruit 400 participants based on simulation-based power calculations. The simulation ensured adequate power to detect a 20% decrease in accuracy with the systematically biased AI model compared with baseline and 10% improvement with AI explanations (eMethods in  3 and the statistical analysis plan in ). Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 16 (StataCorp). Statistical significance was based on a _P_ value <.05. _P_ values for multiple comparisons were not adjusted in the preplanned analyses.## ResultsOf 1024 participants who viewed the study information page, 572 (56%) initiated the study and were randomized ( ; eFigure 4 in ). Four hundred fifty-seven participants completed at least 1 vignette and were included in the primary analysis, including 226 randomized to AI model and explanations. Four hundred eighteen participants completed all 9 vignettes. Study participants were from 13 US states (eTable 3 in ). Participant demographics did not meaningfully differ across randomization groups (eTable 4 in ). The majority (97.6%) of participants’ general practice area was hospital medicine. The median age was 34 years (IQR, 31-39); 241 participants (57.7%) were female; and 19.1% of participants self-reported as Asian, 1.7% as Black, and 68.1% as White. Of all the participants, 31.6% of had previously interacted with clinical decision support tools and 66.7% were unaware that AI could be systematically biased based on patient demographics.### Table.

Accuracy was 67.5% (95% CI, 61.0%-74.0%) for pneumonia, 70.7% (95% CI, 63.1%-78.3%) for heart failure, and 80.5% (95% CI, 74.8%-86.1%) for COPD ( ; eTable 5 in ). Provided with standard AI predictions, participant diagnostic accuracy for each disease category increased to 75.9% (95% CI, 71.3%-80.5%), an increase of 2.9 percentage points (95% CI, 0.5-5.2; _P_\\\\u2009=\\\\u2009.02; ( ; eTables 5 and 6 in ). Providing standard AI predictions with explanations increased accuracy to 77.5% (95% CI, 73.0%-82.0%), an increase of 4.4 percentage points from baseline (95% CI, 2.0-6.9; _P_\\\\u2009<\\\\u2009.001; ; eTables 5 and 6 in ). Participant diagnostic accuracy was 81.1% (95% CI, 76.9%-85.4%) when shown a clinical consultation with perfect accuracy ( ; eTable 5 in ).#### Figure 3. Baseline Diagnostic Accuracy Without AI Models and Percentage Point Differences in Accuracy Across Clinical Vignette Settings.]( in a new tab]( indicates diagnostic accuracy of heart failure, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) when shown clinical vignettes of patients with acute respiratory failure without AI model input; standard model, diagnostic accuracy when shown clinical vignettes and standard AI model diagnostic predictions about whether the patient has heart failure, pneumonia, and/or COPD; standard model plus explanations, diagnostic accuracy when shown standard AI predictions and an image-based AI explanation of the model’s reasoning for making a prediction within vignettes; systematically biased model, diagnostic accuracy when shown systematically biased AI predictions of low accuracy within vignettes; systematically biased model plus explanations, diagnostic accuracy when shown biased model predictions and explanations within vignettes; and clinical consultation, diagnostic accuracy when provided a short narrative describing the rational for the correct diagnosis within the vignette.Subgroup analysis included diagnostic accuracy specific to heart failure, pneumonia, and COPD; clinician profession, including 142 nurse practitioners or physician assistants, and 274 physicians; prior clinical decision–support interaction, including 132 participants who had prior experience interacting with clinical decision support systems and 286 who did not. Diagnostic accuracy and percentage point differences in accuracy were determined by calculating predictive margins and contrasts across vignette settings after fitting a cross-classified generalized random effects model of diagnostic accuracy.Systematically biased AI predictions without explanations decreased participant diagnostic accuracy to 61.7% (95% CI, 55.3%-68.2%), a decrease of 11.3 percentage points (95% CI, 7.2-15.5; _P_\\\\u2009<\\\\u2009.001) from the baseline score ( ; eTables 5 and 6 in ). This was mostly due to a decrease in participants’ diagnostic specificity (73% [95% CI, 71%-75%] to 53% [95% CI, 49%-58%]; eFigure 5 in ). When shown systematically biased AI with explanations, accuracy was 64.0% (95% CI, 57.6%-70.3%), a decrease of 9.1 percentage points (95% CI, 4.9-13.2; _P_ <.001) from the baseline score, which did not significantly differ from clinician diagnostic accuracy with biased AI without explanations (difference, 2.3 percentage points [95% CI, −2.7 to 7.2]; _P_\\\\u2009=\\\\u2009.37; eTables 5 and 7 in ), with little improvement to participants’ diagnostic specificity (53% [95% CI, 49%-58%] to 56% ). The direction of all effects was similar in all exploratory subgroup analyses ( ).### Secondary OutcomesCorrelations between participant responses and standard-model predictions and predictions with explanations were 0.53 (95% CI, 0.50-0.57) and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.56-0.62) respectively (eTable 8 in ). Correlations between participant responses and biased model predictions and predictions with explanations were 0.41 (95% CI, 0.38-0.45) and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.37-0.45), respectively.Treatment selection accuracy was 70.3% (95% CI, 65.5%-75.2%) without model predictions ( ; eTable 9 in ). When shown correct AI predictions, accuracy increased to 77.0% (95% CI, 72.6%-81.4%), an increase of 6.7 percentage points (95% CI, 4.1-9.3; ; eTables 9 and 10 in ). Accuracy was 80.4% (95% CI, 76.3%-84.5%) when shown correct AI predictions and explanations ( ; eTable 9 in ). When provided incorrect model predictions, participants treatment selection accuracy was 55.1% (95% CI, 48.8%-61.3%), a decrease of 15.3 percentage points (95% CI, 11.4-19.1) ( ; eTables 9 and 10 in ). When shown incorrect model predictions, providing explanations did not significantly increase participant accuracy ( ; eTable 11 in ).#### Figure 4.

Treatment selection accuracy and percentage point differences in accuracy were determined by calculating predictive margins and contrasts across vignette settings after fitting a cross-classified generalized random-effects model of treatment selection accuracy across settings.## DiscussionThis study examined how AI predictions and popular image-based AI model explanations could potentially help or worsen clinicians’ diagnostic and treatment decisions in patients with acute respiratory failure. The results showed that clinicians’ diagnostic accuracy improved when shown predictions from a standard AI model, but decreased when shown systematically biased AI predictions. Providing explanations did little to remedy the harmful effects of biased models on clinician accuracy. AI models trained on clinical data are prone to making biased predictions based on clinically irrelevant findings., ,  Left unchecked, models could exacerbate biases widespread in health care, and errors in clinical judgment influenced by AI could have severe consequences such as patient harm.Although the standard and systematically biased models shown in the vignettes had imperfect accuracy, their performance reflected what might be expected in real-world settings for models approved by regulators for difficult tasks like the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure. Even clinicians had only 81.1% diagnostic accuracy when provided perfectly accurate recommendations in the clinical consultation vignettes, which might reflect participant’s difficulty in recognizing perfectly accurate recommendations in these settings. This could also suggest that as AI models improve, there may be an upper bound on collaborative performance between AI models and clinicians for difficult diagnostic tasks.To measure whether explanations could mitigate errors made by systematically biased AI models, explanations were presented in a way that were considered to be obvious—the model relied completely on features unrelated to the clinical condition. Prior work outside of health care has shown that explanations can reduce overreliance on AI models when the task is cognitively difficult, but verifying the explanation is less costly in comparison. Although some have suggested that state-of-the-art explanations should lead to better user-AI interactions, participants in this study were unable to recognize overtly biased models with such explanations. This behavior aligns with work showing that users may still be deceived by incompetent AI models if they fail to understand the models’ simple explanations.Clinicians’ inability to leverage explanations when presented with systematically biased AI models may be due to several reasons. First, clinicians might have limited AI literacy. For example, 66.7% of participants were unaware that AI models could be systematically biased. Informing clinicians of the strengths and weaknesses of AI could make them more adept at leveraging model explanations. Second, clinicians were only shown a small number of the vignettes with explanations, and might need more training with image-based explanations. Third, common image-based AI model explanations, such as those tested in this study, are only approximations of model behavior., ,  They require users to form a mental model of what the explanation is communicating because the AI model cannot communicate in plain language what it is focusing on. It is possible that explanations may be more helpful when presented in a different way (eg, with text descriptions).### Study ImplicationsClinicians’ limited ability to recognize when AI models are systematically biased has important implications for medical AI regulatory policies. The FDA recently released guidance highlighting the importance of providing clinicians with the ability to independently verify clinical support software recommendations., ,  Explanations were also emphasized in the White House blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. Despite providing clinicians with tools with the ability to explain and that could aid them in identifying AI model mistakes, this study demonstrates that the ability to check an AI model’s reasoning using current image-based explanation approaches could fail to provide meaningful safeguards against systematically biased models.There are several potential paths forward to safely integrate AI in health care. First, additional training in limitations of AI systems could be incorporated into medical training, better equipping clinicians to identify biased models. Second, researchers developing explanation tools should involve clinicians to better understand their specific needs. Third, standardizing clinician-facing AI model information in simple language and empirically testing such standards may help clinicians understand appropriate model use and limitations. Finally, this study highlights the critical need for careful model validation, including appropriate subgroup testing, to identify and address biased behavior prior to deployment.### LimitationsThe current study has several limitations. First, it was conducted using a web-based survey interface, which is inherently different from the clinical setting. Second, although study recruitment resulted in a diverse participant population from 14 states, participants were slightly younger (34 years vs 41 years) and more female (53% vs 36%) than prior national statistics of hospitalists, and the design prevented collection of information on nonresponders. Third, the study focused on the effects of AI predictions and explanations among clinicians who make final diagnostic and treatment decisions. Although radiologists have more training in reading chest radiographs and may be more adept at understanding radiograph explanations, they were not included because they are not ultimately responsible for making these diagnostic and treatment decisions.## ConclusionsStandard AI models’ predictions and explanations improved diagnostic accuracy of clinicians, whereas systematically biased predictions and explanations reduced accuracy. Given the unprecedented pace of AI development, it is essential to carefully test AI integration into clinical workflows. Although the findings of the study suggest that clinicians may not be able to serve as a backstop against flawed AI, they can play an essential role in understanding AI’s limitations.Supplement 1.Trial Protocol (652.8KB, pdf)Supplement 2.Statistical Analysis Plan (295.6KB, pdf)Supplement 3.eMethods.**eFigure 1.** Survey instructions page**eFigure 2.** Clinical Vignette Layout**eFigure 3.** Participant Response Form for all nine vignettes**eFigure 4.** CONSORT Flow diagram of participants through the survey**eTable 1.** Characteristics of the patient population used in the vignettes**eTable 2.** Accuracy and AUROC of the standard model and systematically biased models across the full patient cohort (n=45)**eTable 3.** Count by geographical location of responses across the United States**eTable 4.** P-values for demographic differences between the AI model alone group versus the AI model + explanation group**eTable 5.** Cross-classified generalized random effects model estimates of participant accuracy (%) in diagnosing pneumonia, heart failure, and COPD**eTable 6.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ diagnostic accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of no model input, averaged across all three diagnoses**eTable 7.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ diagnostic accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of systematically biased model, averaged across all three diagnoses**eTable 8.** Pearson’s correlation between participant responses and model scores, with 1000 bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals**eTable 9.** Cross-classified generalized random effects model estimates of participant treatment decision accuracy (%) (align with clinical consult)**eTable 10.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ treatment accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of no model input, averaged across all three treatments**eTable 11.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ treatment accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of incorrect model input, averaged across all three treatments**eFigure 5.** Confusion matrices for the participant responses across vignette settings (2.1MB, pdf)Supplement 4.Data Sharing Statement (15.2KB, pdf)## References- 1.Tschandl P, Rinner C, Apalla Z, et al.

Patients underwent an AI medical interview, after which virtual care providers reviewed the interview summary and AI-provided differential diagnoses, communicated with patients, and finalized diagnoses and treatment plans. Our accuracy measures were agreement between AI diagnoses, virtual care providers, and blind adjudicators. We analyzed AI diagnostic agreement across different diagnoses, presenting symptoms, patient demographic characteristics such as race, and provider levels of experience. We also evaluated model performance improvement with retraining.### ResultsProviders selected an AI diagnosis in 84.2% (n = 85,976) of cases and the top-ranked AI diagnosis in 60.9% (n = 62,130) of cases. Agreement rates varied by diagnosis, with greater than or equal to 95% provider agreement with an AI diagnosis for 35 diagnoses (47% of cases, n = 47,679) and greater than or equal to 90% agreement for 57 diagnoses (69% of cases, n = 70,697). The average agreement rate for half of all presenting symptoms was greater than or equal to 90%. Adjusting for case mix, diagnostic accuracy exhibited minimal variation across demographic characteristics. The adjudicators’ consensus diagnosis, reached in 58.2% (n = 128) of adjudicated cases was always included in the AI differential diagnosis. Provider experience did not affect agreement, and model retraining increased diagnostic accuracy for retrained conditions from 96.6% to 98.0%.### ConclusionOur findings show that agreement between AI and provider diagnoses is high in most cases in the setting of this study. The results highlight the potential for AI to enhance primary care disease diagnosis and patient triage, with the capacity to improve over time.- Previousarticle in issue- Nextarticle in issue## Abbreviations and AcronymsAIartificial intelligenceEMRelectronic medical recordICD-10International Classification of Diseases, 10th RevisionRecommended articles© 2023 The Authors.

The focus is on the frequency and types of publications in 2023, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of the current AI landscape in health care and identify areas needing further research. It also aims to address the specialties in medicine with greater use of AI.- Research approach: The authors employed a mixed methods approach, combining classical bibliometric analysis and advanced deep learning techniques to analyze PubMed data. They established search criteria to collect papers published in 2023 related to AI and machine learning in health care, identifying subcategories and medical specialties within the dataset.- Research findings: An increase in AI-related health care publications was observed in 2023, with a total of 23,306 articles, which constitutes a 133.7% increase from the previous year. The analysis revealed a differential uptake of AI models across medical fields, with imaging being the most prevalent. The review also noted a spread across various specialties, with cardiology, gastroenterology, ophthalmology, and general clinics being prominent, while psychiatry had fewer publications.- Interesting aspects: The review provided insights into future AI trends in medicine and health care. The growth of image-based publications and the usefulness of AI in specific health care specialties were particularly noted. The review provides a valuable snapshot of AI’s role in health care research in 2023, highlighting the rapid growth and diverse applications of AI technologies across medical specialties. The authors found AI use in imaging was the most prevalent among the specialties and that other fields, such as gastroenterology, ophthalmology, and psychiatry are promising for future use of AI.- Relation to published literature: The authors attempt to establish their review as a foundational reference for the current state of AI in health care literature for the past year and to set the stage for future comparative analyses. However, prior work in reviewing the use of AI in certain medical fields, such as robotics and hospital administration, which are prevalent in the established literature, have not been thoroughly addressed in the paper and could warrant greater discussion.- Strengths and weaknesses: The review’s reproducibility and the use of mixed methods for bibliometric analysis are strengths of the paper. However, the concept of “mature” AI models could use improvement because of its vagueness, and the limited keyword search is a potential weakness. Suggestions for improvement include adhering to reporting guidelines like PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews), clarifying the definition of “mature” research, and considering the inclusion of “healthcare” in the initial search criteria. Additionally, the time frame of a single recent year is very short considering the fact that AI has been around since the 1956 Dartmouth conference and has long been used in the forefront of health research. The authors should consider suggesting that future studies with longer time frames may be carried out as the applications of AI progress over the years.Below we list major and minor concerns that were discussed by participants of the live review, and where possible, we provide suggestions on how to address those issues.## Major Concerns- The authors should more clearly articulate the generalizability to only within the PubMed corpus and, feasibly, within the search results of their query choice. Alternatively, the authors could consider expanding their search terms to include additional relevant keywords to be more holistic of the range of AI uses within health research or expand their database search outside of PubMed to ensure a broader inclusiveness of the literature.- The Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers (BERT)–based maturity classification model and other AI classification methods encountered difficulties in correctly categorizing publications into their medical specialties. This challenge stemmed from BERT’s vocabulary limitations, as it was only trained on a specific set of tokens, making it struggle with unfamiliar or uncommon terms not present in its training data. The observed accuracy of these models ranged from 30% to 68%, suggesting frequent misclassifications or inaccurate categorizations of publication specialties. The authors should consider further improvements and training of AI models to enhance the accuracy of specialty classification and reduce the occurrence of false positives.- The adoption of multimodal models incorporating diverse data types remains restricted, with image data largely prevailing in AI applications within health care, despite the vast array of available data. The authors should consider implementing multimodal models that combine different data formats such as text, tabular, and voice, as this could significantly enhance the effectiveness and adaptability of AI in health care.- Authors should consider how their study deviates from the “gold standard” PRISMA framework and guidelines and discuss why their method would be preferred over PRISMA in this specific case.- The figures need considerable revision before this would be acceptable for publication. Reviewers recommend the following changes:- For Figure 4B, authors should include a definition of terms to make it clear what exactly AI, machine learning, large language model, natural language processing, etc, refers to in context of the papers scoped.- To improve readability, the authors should organize the visualizations under subheaders. For example, Figures 3 and 5 showing visualizations across health care specialties can be grouped together under one subheader.- For Figure 3, imaging should be analyzed separately as it is a major outlier. For example, breaking it down into the specialties in which imaging was applied, as imaging cuts across all specialties (eg, radiology, oncology, histology)- Data and code should be made freely accessible by default and not incumbent on the reader to “request the data” from the authors. The authors should remedy this oversight before submitting for publication.## Minor Concerns- The authors should more carefully define “maturity.” Typically, in AI, maturity refers to a property of how well established the use of AI is within an organization. It is not clear from the paper how that generalizes to a medical field per se.- The paper should lavish more details on the geographic subanalysis and results.- The authors should provide more details on the justification of why they chose the specific search terms used to define the sampling frame. If possible, the authors should point to an empirical determination of why those specific terms were chosen over other reasonably good choices.- Authors should consider providing more details about the papers scoped, for example, distribution across journals/frequency of journals and most common author-provided keywords.- The authors should explain the term “infodemic” as used in the introduction perhaps by referencing the World Health Organization definition.- Authors should provide support for their claims on the “exponential growth of AI,” for example, by referencing past studies or including visualizations to illustrate this.## Concluding RemarksThe reviewers agree that this paper makes an important and timely contribution to the literature. There are several issues that should be addressed prior to finalization of the manuscript—however, the reviewers believe these concerns are easily addressable by the authors.## AcknowledgmentsPREreview and JMIR Publications thank the authors of the preprint for posting their work openly for feedback.

Alongside the AI model\\\\\\'s accuracy, the software was also able to identify the timescale within which the stroke happened - crucial information for professionals.As Dr Paul Bentley, consultant neurologist, told the _Health Tech Newspaper_: “For the majority of strokes caused by a blood clot, if a patient is within 4.5 hours of the stroke happening, he or she is eligible for both medical and surgical treatments. Up to 6 hours, the patient is also eligible for surgical treatment, but after this time point, deciding whether these treatments might be beneficial becomes tricky, as more cases become irreversible.

Their study addresses the problem of imbalanced datasets, which can bias predictions, and employs seven classifiers: K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network, Gradient Boost, XGBoost, and Random Forest. The optimized XGBoost model achieved an outstanding performance with an accuracy of 98.50%, a precision of 99.14%, 98.29% recall, and an F1 score of 98.71%, significantly enhancing diagnostic accuracy for heart disease.Lee et al. ] evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of two AI techniques, namely KARA-CXR and ChatGPT, in chest X-ray reading. Using 2000 chest X-ray images, their study assessed accuracy, false findings, location inaccuracies, count inaccuracies, and hallucinations. They found that KARA-CXR significantly outperformed ChatGPT regarding diagnostic accuracy (70.50% vs. 40.50%, according to one observer), false findings, and non-hallucination rate (75% vs. 38%). Both systems showed moderate inter-observer agreement. Their study highlights the superior performance of KARA-CXR in medical imaging diagnostics compared to ChatGPT.Marquez et al. ] focused on using machine learning to differentiate between positive and negative influenza patients in Mexico, where influenza has been a persistent issue since 2009. They used a dataset of 15,480 records from 2010 to 2020, containing clinical and demographic data of patients tested with RT-qPCR. This study evaluated various classification methods and found that Random Forest and Bagging classifiers perform best in terms of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, F1 score, and the AUC. These methods show promise for aiding clinical diagnosis in settings where molecular tests are impractical.Ali et al. ] investigated detecting Parkinson’s disease (PD) using voice attributes from both PD patients and healthy individuals. They employed filter feature selection to remove quasi-constant features and tested several classification models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models, on two datasets. Remarkable results were achieved on Dataset 1, with the Decision Tree and Random Forest methods achieving impressive accuracy. Ensemble learning methods (voting, stacking, and bagging) were applied to further enhance the results, and genetic selection was also tested for accuracy and precision. Their study found higher precision in predicting PD patients and better overall performance when using Dataset 1 compared to Dataset 2.Zakareya et al. ] propose a new deep learning model for breast cancer classification, incorporating features like granular computing and attention mechanisms to achieve enhanced accuracy and reduce the workload of doctors. Their model’s effectiveness is demonstrated by its superior performance compared to other models on two case studies, achieving 93% and 95% accuracy on ultrasound and histopathology images, respectively.Al-rimy et al. ] examined the use of DenseNet169 for knee osteoarthritis detection using X-ray images.

Their review highlights the potential of AI and computational intelligence to revolutionize the assessment and treatment of stuttering, enabling personalized and effective approaches for improving the lives of people who have a stutter.## 3. LimitationsAlthough the articles published in this Special Issue present valuable contributions to the field of medical diagnostics leveraging AI and machine learning (ML) techniques, some limitations can be identified across these articles:- (1)Many of these studies have specific focuses or use case scenarios, potentially limiting the generalizability of their findings to broader contexts or populations;- (2)Some articles may have methodological limitations, such as biases in data collection, imbalanced datasets, or reliance on specific classifiers, which could affect the reliability and applicability of their results;- (3)While many studies report impressive results in performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, the evaluation criteria and datasets used may not fully reflect real-world clinical scenarios, leading to potential overestimations of performance;- (4)The interpretation of results may vary across the studies, being potentially influenced by the researchers’ perspectives or biases, which could impact the conclusions drawn from the data.## 4. Future DirectionsMedical image diagnosis powered by artificial intelligence (AI) represents the cutting edge of improvements in healthcare. We should continually strive to enhance the health and wellbeing of our community by providing smart solutions that benefit both patients and physicians. AI technology has significantly advanced medical image diagnosis, improving accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility in healthcare scenarios. AI algorithms can analyze X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, and patient records, such as those of patients with coronary stenosis or Parkinson’s disease, to detect abnormalities such as tumors, fractures, and infections. For example, AI can identify early-stage cancers that might be missed by the human eye. AI can interpret echocardiograms (ECGs) and cardiac MRI scans to detect heart conditions like arrhythmias, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. In light of this, this Special Issue highlights and disseminates the latest breakthroughs in AI-driven diagnostic technologies, with the aim of showcasing innovative research, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and exploring the transformative impact of AI on medical imaging and diagnosis. By bringing together contributions from leading experts, we hope to advance this field of research, improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, and ultimately enhance patient care and health outcomes.The recent rise of large language models (LLMs) like Gemini and medGemini , ] or ChatGPT and BiomedGPT ] presents a transformative opportunity for the healthcare industry, particularly in the realm of diagnosis. These powerful tools can significantly enhance existing diagnostic systems by providing more insightful explanations, ultimately leading to more accurate and efficient patient care. One key contribution of LLMs lies in their ability to generate detailed textual reports. By analyzing vast amounts of medical data, including patient history, test results, and relevant research, LLMs can produce comprehensive reports that not only outline a diagnosis but also explain the reasoning behind it. This detailed explanation assists healthcare professionals by offering a transparent and step-by-step breakdown of how the LLM arrived at its conclusions, fostering trust in the system and allowing doctors to leverage the LLM’s insights while incorporating their own medical expertise. While LLMs cannot directly generate heat maps (i.e., saliency maps) for medical images, they can play a significant role in the process. When integrated with computer vision models, LLMs are able to analyze medical images (X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, etc.), and they can be trained to detect and extract relevant features, anomalies, and patterns from these images. Through this, LLMs have the ability to generate textual descriptions of these highlighted areas that explain why they are important for a certain diagnosis. This provides a form of visual explanation alongside the LLM’s textual report. The combined power of detailed textual explanations and visual heat maps can empower healthcare professionals in several ways:- (1)It improves diagnostic accuracy by offering a comprehensive understanding of the LLM’s reasoning;- (2)It facilitates communication with patients by providing clear and accessible explanations of the diagnostic process , ];- (3)It fosters collaboration between humans and machines, allowing medical professionals to leverage the strengths of LLMs while retaining their own irreplaceable role in healthcare decision making ].However, it is crucial to acknowledge that LLMs are still under development, and their integration into healthcare systems requires careful consideration. Ensuring data privacy and security is paramount, and ongoing human oversight remains essential. In conclusion, LLM-based tools like Gemini and GPTs (Generative Pre-Trained Transformers) hold immense potential to revolutionize healthcare diagnostics. As mentioned above, the detailed textual explanations and visual heat maps provided by these tools can empower healthcare professionals by allowing them gain a deeper understanding of the diagnostic process, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency in patient care. As LLM technology continues to evolve, the future of healthcare diagnosis promises to be one of increased transparency, collaboration, and, ultimately, improved patient outcomes. The development of robust medical XAI models is often hindered by the limited availability of labeled datasets, particularly for rare diseases or specific imaging modalities. Generative AI techniques ] offer promising solutions to address this challenge, enabling the creation of synthetic medical data across various modalities—text, images, signals, etc. LLMs like GPT-3 excel at generating synthetic patient records that closely mimic the structure, terminology, and statistical distributions of real clinical notes. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have revolutionized medical image synthesis, producing realistic X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans that can incorporate specific anatomical variations or pathologies. This not only increases the size of datasets but allows researchers to simulate diverse disease presentations. Additionally, GANs can augment datasets by introducing realistic variations to existing images or even by translating images between modalities (e.g., generating a potential CT scan from an MRI scan), reducing the reliance on acquiring data in multiple ways. Generative models are able to synthesize physiological signals like ECGs, EEGs, and others, replicating real-world patterns and anomalies. This can be leveraged to expand training data for diagnostic models and facilitate the development of monitoring devices. Furthermore, generative AI can create hybrid signals with controlled variations, simulating complex or unusual health conditions to diversify training data.Finally, we can potentially leverage contrastive learning ] to address the challenge of data-labeling exhaustion in the development of LLM-based tools similar to medGemini or BiomedGPT. Contrastive learning is a technique within self-supervised learning where a machine learning model learns by creating its own supervisory signals from unlabeled data. The primary goal of this is to train a model to recognize similarities and differences between data samples: the model learns an embedding space (a kind of representational map) where similar items are clustered together and dissimilar items are far apart. Meanwhile, deep active learning could prove to be capable of supporting and automating the process of labeling medical data.## 5. ConclusionsIn conclusion, this Special Issue underscores the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in medical diagnostics, as evidenced by the collection of cutting-edge research it presents. While these advancements offer unprecedented accuracy and efficiency in disease detection and treatment planning across various medical fields, including radiology, pathology, genomics, and personalized medicine, several limitations persist. These limitations include the potential lack of generalizability, methodological constraints, and the need for the careful interpretation of results. Looking ahead, the integration of large language models (LLMs) like Gemini and medGemini holds promise for further revolutionizing healthcare diagnosis through empowering healthcare professionals with detailed textual explanations and visual heat maps to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis. Despite these advancements, however, ongoing considerations for data privacy, security, and human oversight are essential. Ultimately, the future of healthcare diagnosis promises increased transparency, collaboration, and improved patient outcomes as AI technology continues to evolve and move forward to address current challenges.## AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) for providing support by means of a wide range of research grants from the Korean government (MSIT) (No. RS-2022-00166402 and RS-2023-00256517) for improving AI-based medical diagnostics.

And yet, \"AI digital health solutions hold the potential to enhance efficiency, reduce costs and improve health outcomes globally,\" says the white paper. Here are seven examples of AI technologies already making a difference in the medical field.AI and healthcare2018201920202021202220232024Year010864212Billions $A Flourish chart]( AI can interpret brain scansA new AI software is \" \" as professionals at examining the brain scans of stroke patients. Two UK universities trained the software on a dataset of 800 brain scans of stroke patients and then trialled it on 2,000 patients.The results were impressive. Alongside the AI model\\\\\\'s accuracy, the software was also able to identify the timescale within which the stroke happened - crucial information for professionals.As Dr Paul Bentley, consultant neurologist, told the _Health Tech Newspaper_: “For the majority of strokes caused by a blood clot, if a patient is within 4.5 hours of the stroke happening, he or she is eligible for both medical and surgical treatments. Up to 6 hours, the patient is also eligible for surgical treatment, but after this time point, deciding whether these treatments might be beneficial becomes tricky, as more cases become irreversible. So it’s essential for doctors to know both the initial onset time, as well as whether a stroke could be reversed.”## AI can spot more bone fractures than humans canSurprisingly, urgent care doctors miss broken bones in up to 10% of cases. What’s more, X-ray technicians are both in short supply and overloaded.So using  could potentially avoid both unnecessary X-rays and missed fractures. The UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says the technology is safe, reliable and could reduce the need for follow-up appointments.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesBut there are concerns around the fast rollout of AI in healthcare.\"It is important that people using these tools are properly trained in doing so, meaning they  from technological limitations ... such as the possibility for wrong information being given,\" Dr Caroline Green of the Institute for Ethics in AI at the University of Oxford told the BBC.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum creating guardrails for Artificial Intelligence?Show moreIn response to the uncertainties surrounding generative AI and the need for robust AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes for all, the Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) has launched the .The Alliance unites industry leaders, governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations to champion responsible global design and release of transparent and inclusive AI systems.This includes the workstreams part of the , in collaboration with the Centre for Energy and Materials, the Centre for Advanced Manufacturing and Supply Chains, the Centre for Cybersecurity, the Centre for Nature and Climate, and the Global Industries team.## Assessing ambulance needs with AIIn the UK, around  are taken by ambulance to hospital each month. It’s down to paramedics to decide who does or doesn’t need to go, and always with an awareness of how few beds are available.A study in Yorkshire in the north of England found that in 80% of cases . The AI model was trained on factors such as a patient’s mobility, pulse and blood oxygen levels and chest pain – it also proved to respond without bias. NICE did caution, however, that before being put into more widespread use, more training was needed.## Detecting early signs of more than 1,000 diseasesA new AI machine learning model can  before the patient is even aware of any symptoms, according to its maker AstraZeneca.Using medical data from 500,000 people who are part of a UK health data repository, the machine could “predict with high confidence a disease diagnosis many years later”.Slavé Petrovski, who led the research, told Sky News: \"For many of these diseases, by the time they manifest clinically and the individual goes to the doctor because of an ailment or visible observation, that is far down the line from when the disease process began.“We can pick up signatures in an individual that are highly predictive of developing , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney disease and many others,\" he said.Another UK study has found that an AI tool can successfully detect .

But ChatRWD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system – which essentially combines LLMs with retrieval systems to improve output – produced useful answers to  (compared with 2%-10% for the LLMs).Digital interfaces are increasingly being rolled out to help triage patients, too. In an , part of the World Economic Forum’s , a case study on digital patient platform Huma, revealed it could reduce readmission rates by 30%, time spent reviewing patients by up to 40% and “alleviated the workload of healthcare providers”.The report anticipates a future in which technologies like these could “dramatically transform the patient experience. People who are generally healthy can use self-monitoring devices to optimize their mental and physical health, while those with health issues will have access to a wide range of digital solutions”.## AI and traditional medicinePracticed in 170 countries and used by billions of people, traditional medicine has maintained its relevance in the modern world in part because of its emphasis on a holistic approach to healthcare. And while . A new brief from the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, \\\\\\'Mapping the application of artificial intelligence in traditional medicine\\\\\\', shows how  (TCIM) while protecting cultural heritage.India is the first country to launch a , utilizing AI tools to catalogue and analyze indigenous medical texts. The country is also exploring how AI and Ayurgenomics - a field which combines the ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda with modern genomics - can intersect, to see what herbal formulations could help tackle modern diseases.Similarly, , while in South Korea, AI is being used to analyze traditional medicine compounds to treat blood disorders.The global TCIM market is expected to reach nearly $600 billion in 2025 - and AI looks set to accelerate that market further and faster. The new brief stresses the importance of safeguarding  in the process.“AI must not become a new frontier for exploitation,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Systems. “We must ensure that Indigenous Peoples and local communities are not only protected but are active partners in shaping the future of AI in traditional medicine.”##### Have you read?- ##### - ##### - ##### ## AI for healthcare adminAdministrative tasks are both inevitable and time-consuming in the medical field. Using AI co-pilots could free up clinicians to focus more of their time on patients.Microsoft has recently announced its , an AI healthcare tool that can listen to, and create notes on, clinical consultations. And  already has a suite of AI models specifically tailored to alleviate some of the administrative burdens in healthcare. In Germany, an AI platform called  has cut testing and diagnosis times from weeks to hours and its founders are determined to show that the technology \"can be an ally, not an obstacle\". Co-founder Dr Sebastian Casu told EU-Startups: \"No one joins the healthcare sector to spend hours on admin\".Of course, having an AI tool listening in and taking notes on your doctor\\\\\\'s appointment will not appeal to everyone. A recent study in the UK found that just  (although over two-thirds are comfortable with the technology being used to free up professionals\\\\\\' time). Then there is the question of accuracy. A report last year found that OpenAI\\\\\\'s Whisper, used by many hospitals to summarize patient meetings, was .This is why regulation of AI tools is so vital. In the UK, AI-powered medical devices are strictly regulated by the .). In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last year  and concluded that, while the FDA will “continue to play a central role in ensuring safe, effective, and trustworthy AI tools” it was also essential that “all involved entities … attend to AI with the rigour this transformative technology merits”.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookies##### Don\\\\\\'t miss any update on this topicCreate a free account and access your personalized content collection with our latest publications and analyses.License and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.##### Share:!## Forum StoriesnewsletterBringing you weekly curated insights and analysis on the global issues that matter.### More onHealth and Healthcare Systems      Camila Pintarelli and Thomas OxleyOctober 9, 2025Bushra AlBlooshi, Hoda Al Khzaimi and Heba AhmadOctober 8, 2025Hoda Al Khzaimi, Bushra AlBlooshi and Heba AhmadOctober 7, 2025Joan-Paula Bor and Kathleen SchmelerOctober 6, 2025Naoko TochibayashiOctober 3, 2025Oct 2, 2025EN   Remove menu\\'}, {\\'title\\': \\'Improving Patient Care and Safety With AI - Healthcare Executive\\', \\'url\\': \\'https://www.healthcareexecutive.org/archives/march-april-2024/improving-patient-care--and-safety-with-ai\\', \\'markdown\\': \\'By Topic: TechnologyInformation ManagementSafety QualityBy Collection: Safety![]( intelligence has demonstrated that it can improve patient care and safety by helping clinicians analyze imaging and pathology reports.\\\\xa0Many applications, though, are still in the early stages of development and adoption, especially in the automation of administrative tasks.“For quality care, I believe AI allows us to augment clinical decision-making,” says Sachin Shah, MD, an associate professor of medicine and pediatrics and chief medical information officer at UChicago Medicine in Chicago. He notes there is a sizable predictive analytics and machine learning space that can significantly leverage the large amount of data available. As a result, “we can better identify patterns, predict health issues and customize treatment plans,” Shah says.Achieving that level of precision and personalization at the patient level will help improve outcomes and streamline many care-delivery processes, according to Shah.Patient safety is also enhanced by AI’s capacity to analyze vast volumes of data in real time. “This can lead to early detection of clinical deterioration, intervention ahead of potential adverse drug reactions and an overall reduction of medical errors,” Shah says. “Clinicians are alerted sooner that something may be trending in the wrong direction, well before it may become clinically evident.”### AI’s PotentialRichard Greenhill, DHA, CPHQ, FACHE, director of the undergraduate healthcare management program in the School of Health Professions at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, says high-quality healthcare depends on reliable and accurate processes in the delivery of patient care “to ensure that safety is prioritized for sustainable outcomes. Process variation is the enemy of quality, so the tools of AI are exciting because they can undertake some of the more routine and repeatable processes that are susceptible to the impact of human factors.”The TTUHSC Institute of Telehealth and Digital Innovation was established in September 2023 to create a digital health ecosystem, where technologies such as AI transform care delivery in West Texas. “AI has the potential to unleash new ways of approaching performance improvement and patient safety as we begin to tap into the universe of data that encompasses health—both inside and outside of the delivery system,” says Greenhill.Systems thinking is also an important component of quality care. “Systems thinking in care delivery helps us focus on interrelationships in processes to solve complex problems in our quality improvement strategy,” Greenhill explains. “This is why we should not ever first blame people when a medical mistake or undesired event occurs. A system produces the results for which it was designed. Thus, a person or a tool, such as AI in our delivery system, can never itself be the focus when an error occurs.”Healthcare facilities must look deeply at the design\\\\xa0of how these resources were planned for and supported in their activities, according to Greenhill. AI allows\\\\xa0“us to look across interprofessional processes and aggregate datasets to discover insights that we may not\\\\xa0have assumed.” Examples include early detection via analysis of diagnostic studies, such as radiology and clinical lab, and more quickly identifying high-risk patients based on treatment and disease progression. “AI can assist quality professionals, clinicians and\\\\xa0leaders to make sense of the complexities in our systems in managing risks associated with handoffs,\\\\xa0care coordination and treatment interventions,” Greenhill says.AI can enhance patient care in everything from ophthalmology to cardiology and pathology/oncology to psychiatry, according to Thomas Fuchs, DrSc, dean of the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine in New York City. “AI should help physicians to be faster and more effective, do new things they currently cannot do and reduce burnout,” he says.Even before the AI department was established in the fall of 2021, Mount Sinai was testing AI systems in the ICU to alert nurses to patient risk of malnutrition, deterioration or fall, along with reducing false alarms and staff overhead. The AI system takes information from the EHR and various devices in the ICU.Cancer detection. AI has also benefited pathology at Mount Sinai by detecting cancer and grading cancer earlier than before. The institution has developed an AI foundation model based on 3 billion images from 400,000 digital microscopy slides of cancer biopsies and resections. “The model can detect biomarkers to predict what cancer treatment will work for a specific patient,” Fuchs says.Diagnostic imaging assisted by AI holds promise, as well. A retrospective study published online in European Radiology in March 2023 concluded that among more than 1,200 breast cancer cases in Norway, an AI system scored 93% of the screen-detected cancers and 40% of the interval cancers with an AI score of 10 (on a scale of 1 to 10, based on the risk of malignancy). Furthermore, the AI system scored all screen-detected cancers and nearly 50% of interval cancers in women with the highest breast density with an AI score of 10. This resulted in a sensitivity of 80.9% for women with the highest breast density for the AI system, compared to 62.8% for independent double reading by radiologists.Roughly 40% of the screen-detected cancers achieved an AI score of 10 on the prior mammograms, indicating a potential for earlier detection by using AI in screen-reading.Physicians at the Breast Center at Mount Sinai Medical Center believe that the use of AI for detecting new abnormalities in mammograms and MRI scans is promising. They also predict that AI will help radiologists interpret mammograms while reducing the number of false positive interpretations, thus avoiding unnecessary biopsies. However, further research is needed to ensure the technology’s reliability and the anticipated benefits.Informatics. Excitement about the potential for AI led the University of Kentucky to form a multidisciplinary collaborative of physicians, data scientists, biomedical engineers and others to form the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Alliance. After two years of success in starting projects around radiology, pharmacy and cancer, the alliance merged in 2022 with an innovations program to form the Center for Applied AI within biomedical informatics for even broader AI applications across healthcare and the university. Most AI healthcare initiatives at the university hospital stem from a desire to improve quality of care and reporting, such as better implementing the recommendation from the Society of Thoracic Surgery that a patient take a beta-blocker within 24 hours of surgery. Using tools already developed or in development in one discipline allows center members to more quickly apply solutions to other projects.A chatbot is being developed at the college that will connect with patients preparing to undergo cardiac surgery. The chatbot would help guide patients on when to take their medicine and help answer questions they may have about the surgery.Over the past year, there has been a rapid increase in the optimization of administrative tasks completed via AI, including documentation, prior authorizations and revenue cycling. “We are also able to better communicate with our patients and give our patients more self-efficacy,” Shah of UChicago Medicine says. “Conversational AI is very well suited to replace many of the burdensome nonclinical tasks that do not require clinical judgement.AI offers an opportunity to enhance quality care by augmenting clinical decision-making, according to Shah. “Through predictive analytics and machine learning, we can leverage vast amounts of data to identify patterns, predict potential health issues and customize treatment plans for individual patients. This personalization can significantly improve outcomes and streamline care delivery processes.”Similarly, AI’s role in patient safety “lies in its ability to analyze data in real time, allowing for early detection of potential risks such as adverse drug interactions or deteriorating patient condition,” Shah says. AI-powered systems can also assist in proactive interventions, thus reducing medical errors and ensuring timely and accurate care, all of which ultimately safeguard patient well-being.UChicago Medicine is scheduled to begin a pilot study this spring comprising 250 of its physicians to leverage generative AI to streamline and take over much of the clinical documentation.Some EHR providers include AI algorithms in their products, according to Greenhill. “These tools show promise to augment and enhance work for clinicians,” he says. “However, as these tools become more widely used, we need to maintain vigilance about the risk that they pose to patients and processes due to model and data bias.”AI chatbots—automated software applications—can perform many mundane tasks and reduce the burden on staff, physicians and nurses so they can pursue “the meaningful work they signed up to do, such as physicians spending more time with patients,” Greenhill says.“If a human does the same task 10 times every hour,\\\\xa0he or she is more likely to make a mistake due to a\\\\xa0host of human factors,” Greenhill says. By contrast,\\\\xa0AI chatbots can operate nonstop, requiring neither breaks nor rest. “This is a win in the war on process variation,” he says.Surgical care. Danielle Walsh, MD, FAAP, FACS, a professor of surgery and vice chair of Surgery for Quality and Process Improvement at the University\\\\xa0of Kentucky College of Medicine in Lexington, was part of a panel of surgeons who discussed the impact\\\\xa0of AI on surgical practices at the American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress 2023 in October. By allowing AI to take over many of the repetitive and rote administrative tasks that burden physicians, “the physician can perform more cognitive decision-making and focus more on human connections and time spent with patients,” says Walsh.AI will also play a major role in mandatory reporting of quality metrics to governmental and other entities, according to Walsh, freeing up even more staff members to perform more substantial work to truly improve quality of care. A study published online in JAMA Network in June 2023 on resources spent on just measuring and reporting data on 162 unique quality metrics found that an estimated 108,478 person-hours with a personnel cost of $5 million and another $603,000 in vendor fees were required. “Those funds are better spent on interventions than reporting,” Walsh says.AI tools also can communicate with a patient at home to ensure drug adherence, collect feedback on how patients are feeling, and use that feedback to become more connected with the patient in between visits or after discharge from the hospital. “And if you add in digital sensors, we can do tremendous monitoring at home,” Walsh says. “During COVID, people at home were at ICU-level care.”A patient with a blood vessel bypassed in the leg, for example, could wear a sock with a sensor at home to detect if blood flow begins to decrease before the blood vessel blocks off again and before the patient develops a blue, painful foot. “AI combined with sensors will allow us to intervene earlier and prevent more serious complications,” Walsh says.### Looking ForwardAs for AI cost, some healthcare facilities already have 5G network capability, along with modern wiring and systems that are compatible with AI, while others will need to invest in infrastructure improvements. “There will also be tradeoffs,” Walsh says. “Because AI requires a tremendous amount of computing power, you are not going to be able to run every AI algorithm simultaneously. And as the area grows, you will need to prioritize AI systems that meet the needs of a specific institution and the specific patient population being served.”Which areas of AI to pursue differ by organization and their culture, according to Shah, and are determined by staffing and the ability of teams and leadership to adjust. “There is not necessarily a lot of replacement of human expertise coming, but certainly a lot of reallocating human resources to different work that is ideally more top-of-license work, by automating some of the repetitive administrative tasks and algorithmic work,” he says.However, the quality of the output from AI is contingent on the quality of data entered, “so you need to invest a lot into your data infrastructure,” Shah says. “The quality of your data needs to be high.”There are also ethical considerations. “There has to be clear transparency around the decision-making in these models,” Shah says. “The concept of algorithmic bias is really important to understand and to ensure we are minimizing. Humans need to be at the center to carefully scrutinize any potential bias by closely monitoring the inputs, the algorithms and outputs to ensure they are not leading to unintended consequences.”_Bob Kronemyer is a freelance writer based in Elkhart, Ind._### Acceptance and Implementation StrategiesDanielle Walsh, MD, FAAP, FACS, a professor of surgery and vice chair of Surgery for Quality and Process Improvement at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine in Lexington, believes there are two big myths about using AI in healthcare: that physicians don’t want AI and that patients don’t want AI.****\\'}]\\n[{\\'title\\': \\'AI in Healthcare Statistics: Market Insights & Growth - Binariks\\', \\'url\\': \\'https://binariks.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-ai-healthcare-market/\\', \\'markdown\\': \\'- ![]( ![]( ![]( AI in Healthcare Statistics: Market Insights & GrowthUpdated Jun 26, 2025 · 9 min readHealthcareData Science and AI/MLAI DevelopmentContent      !Artificial Intelligence has a great demand in the healthcare industry.

However, accuracy significantly decreased by 11.3% when clinicians were shown systematically biased AI model predictions and model explanations did not mitigate the negative effects of such predictions.### MeaningAI model explanations did not help clinicians recognize systematically biased AI models.## Abstract### ImportanceArtificial intelligence (AI) could support clinicians when diagnosing hospitalized patients; however, systematic bias in AI models could worsen clinician diagnostic accuracy. Recent regulatory guidance has called for AI models to include explanations to mitigate errors made by models, but the effectiveness of this strategy has not been established.### ObjectivesTo evaluate the impact of systematically biased AI on clinician diagnostic accuracy and to determine if image-based AI model explanations can mitigate model errors.### Design, Setting, and ParticipantsRandomized clinical vignette survey study administered between April 2022 and January 2023 across 13 US states involving hospitalist physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants.### InterventionsClinicians were shown 9 clinical vignettes of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory failure, including their presenting symptoms, physical examination, laboratory results, and chest radiographs. Clinicians were then asked to determine the likelihood of pneumonia, heart failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as the underlying cause(s) of each patient’s acute respiratory failure. To establish baseline diagnostic accuracy, clinicians were shown 2 vignettes without AI model input. Clinicians were then randomized to see 6 vignettes with AI model input with or without AI model explanations. Among these 6 vignettes, 3 vignettes included standard-model predictions, and 3 vignettes included systematically biased model predictions.### Main Outcomes and MeasuresClinician diagnostic accuracy for pneumonia, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.### ResultsMedian participant age was 34 years (IQR, 31-39) and 241 (57.7%) were female. Four hundred fifty-seven clinicians were randomized and completed at least 1 vignette, with 231 randomized to AI model predictions without explanations, and 226 randomized to AI model predictions with explanations. Clinicians’ baseline diagnostic accuracy was 73.0% (95% CI, 68.3% to 77.8%) for the 3 diagnoses. When shown a standard AI model without explanations, clinician accuracy increased over baseline by 2.9 percentage points (95% CI, 0.5 to 5.2) and by 4.4 percentage points (95% CI, 2.0 to 6.9) when clinicians were also shown AI model explanations. Systematically biased AI model predictions decreased clinician accuracy by 11.3 percentage points (95% CI, 7.2 to 15.5) compared with baseline and providing biased AI model predictions with explanations decreased clinician accuracy by 9.1 percentage points (95% CI, 4.9 to 13.2) compared with baseline, representing a nonsignificant improvement of 2.3 percentage points (95% CI, −2.7 to 7.2) compared with the systematically biased AI model.### Conclusions and RelevanceAlthough standard AI models improve diagnostic accuracy, systematically biased AI models reduced diagnostic accuracy, and commonly used image-based AI model explanations did not mitigate this harmful effect.### Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: * * *This randomized clinical vignette study examines whether providing AI explanations to biased AI models enhances clinician diagnostic accuracy.## IntroductionArtificial intelligence (AI) shows promise in identifying abnormalities in clinical images, such as pneumonia from chest radiographs, diabetic retinopathy from fundus images, or skin cancer from histopathology images., , ,  AI models in clinical care analyze patient data, identify patterns, and make predictions. Integrating AI into clinical decision-making may result in higher accuracy than a clinician without AI. However, systematically biased AI models (ie, models that consistently misdiagnose patient subpopulations) can lead to errors and potential harm., ,  For example, an AI model trained on data in which female patients are consistently underdiagnosed for heart disease may learn this bias and underdiagnose females if deployed. Physician performance can be harmed by following incorrect predictions, a phenomenon known as _overreliance_. Ideally, clinicians would be able to follow AI predictions when correct but ignore incorrect AI predictions. However, the extent to which AI can be safely integrated to support diagnostic decisions is still largely unknown.Recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance highlights the importance of providing clinicians with the ability to independently review the basis for software recommendations, including the information and logic used in a model’s decisions. Although AI developers frequently use AI explanations to debug models during development, providing similar explanations to clinicians, as recommended by the FDA, could potentially enhance interpretability after deployment. Explanations could help clinicians better understand a model’s logic before acting on its recommendation, helping to mitigate errors made by systematically biased models. For example, image-based explanations designed to highlight important regions of an image that were used in an AI model’s decision could help clinicians identify when models are behaving inaccurately.To determine if providing AI explanations could enhance clinician diagnostic accuracy and alleviate the negative impact of systematically biased models, we conducted a randomized clinical vignette web-based survey study. We focused on the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure as a test case for this broader challenge because acute respiratory failure is commonly encountered in practice, often misdiagnosed, and evaluated using commonly encountered data such as chest radiographs that AI tools can analyze. We presented participants with standard and systematically biased AI, randomizing participants to see AI predictions alone or AI predictions with explanations. This design allowed us to test our hypothesis that systematically biased models would harm clinician diagnostic accuracy, but commonly used image-based explanations would help clinicians partially recover their performance.## Methods### ParticipantsWe recruited hospitalist physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants who commonly care for patients with acute respiratory failure to complete the study. The study protocol is available in  and the statistical analysis plan in . We first identified 12 hospitalist leaders as site champions through interaction with the Society of Hospital Medicine research committee and the authors’ personal contacts. Site champions advertised the study via email to their local hospital medicine divisions. Each site champion sent a follow-up reminder email after 2 weeks. Interested participants were directed to the study landing page, which confirmed study eligibility, provided additional study information, study instructions, and obtained informed consent prior to randomization (see the study protocol in  and eFigure 1 in ). Participants were offered a $50 gift card for completing the study.This study was deemed exempt by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. Although the study was not registered initially given its vignette-based design, to ensure it was appropriately reflected in the trial literature, it was registered on ClinicialTrials.gov after its completion with the registration parameters based on the prespecified protocol.### Clinical VignettesWe created 45 clinical vignettes based on patients hospitalized with acute respiratory failure in 2017 at the University of Michigan. Patients were selected to achieve study goals while being representative of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory failure (see eMethods in ). A study team member reviewed each patient’s chart to create a succinct version of the patient’s presenting history, past medical history, current medications, physical examination findings, laboratory findings, and chest radiograph for each vignette (eFigure 2 in ). At least 4 pulmonary physicians independently reviewed each patient’s complete medical record to determine if pneumonia, heart failure, and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was the patient’s underlying diagnosis.Each vignette had 3 reference diagnostic labels pertaining to pneumonia, heart failure, and COPD based on the average of these reviews, and each reference label was binary, indicating whether the disease was present or absent. See eTable 1 in  for patient characteristics for additional details.### Study DesignThe survey was conducted using a Qualtrics survey tool. Participants were assigned 9 of 45 clinical vignettes to review. All participants followed the same vignette order: 2 vignettes without AI predictions, 6 vignettes with AI predictions, and 1 vignette with a clinical consultation by a hypothetical colleague ( ). Upon study initiation, all participants were randomized to AI predictions with or without AI explanations for all 6 AI vignettes, and all participants were also randomized to see 1 of 3 types of systematically biased AI models during 3 of the 6 AI vignettes.#### Figure 1. Randomization and Study Flow Diagram for the 9 Clinical Vignettes.]( in a new tab]( completing informed consent, participants were randomized to artificial intelligence (AI) predictions with or without explanations and all participants were also randomized to 1 of 3 types of systematically biased AI models during a subset of vignettes in the study. The 3 systematically biased AI models included a model predicting pneumonia if aged 80 years or older, a model predicting heart failure if body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 30 or higher, and a model predicting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) if a blur was applied to the radiograph. Participants were first shown 2 vignettes without AI predictions to measure baseline diagnostic accuracy. The next 6 vignettes included AI predictions. If the participant was randomized to see AI explanations, the participant was also shown an AI model explanation with the AI predictions. Three vignettes had standard AI predictions, and 3 had biased AI predictions shown in random order. The final vignette included a clinical consultation, a short narrative provided by a hypothetical trusted colleague who identified the correct diagnosis and their diagnostic rationale.The first 2 vignettes did not include AI predictions and were used to measure baseline diagnostic accuracy. The next 6 vignettes included AI predictions immediately after the patient case. If randomized to see AI explanations, the participant was also shown an image-based AI model explanation alongside the AI predictions. Three vignettes had standard AI predictions and 3 had biased predictions shown in random order. The final vignette included a clinical consultation, a short narrative provided by a hypothetical trusted colleague describing the rationale behind the most likely diagnosis and recommended treatments. By design, the clinical consultation vignette always recommended the correct diagnosis and treatment, serving as a realistic upper bound of participant diagnostic accuracy when provided accurate recommendations.After each vignette, participants were asked to separately assess how likely pneumonia, heart failure, or COPD was contributing to the patient’s respiratory failure on a scale of 0 to 100 (eFigure 3 in ). Responses were collected on a continuous scale to calculate the correlation between AI model scores and participant responses. In calculating accuracy, responses of 50 or higher were considered positive for the diagnosis. Patients could have 1, more than 1, or none of the conditions. After completing the diagnostic assessment, participants were asked whether they would administer any combination of steroids, antibiotics, intravenous (IV) diuretics, or none of these treatments to the patient.### Standard and Systematically Biased AI Model Predictions and ExplanationsWhen participants were shown AI predictions, the model provided a score for each diagnosis on a scale of 0 to 100 estimating how likely the patient’s symptoms were due to pneumonia, heart failure, and COPD ( ). Standard AI predictions were generated using a machine learning model trained using standard approaches on a separate data set. All participants were randomized to see 1 of 3 systematically biased AI models: (1) a model predicting a high likelihood of pneumonia for a patient who was 80 years or older; (2) a model predicting a high likelihood of heart failure if a patient’s body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 30 or higher; and (3) a model predicting a high likelihood of COPD if a blur was applied to the radiograph (eMethods in ). Vignettes with biased models were shown for patients with attributes leading the biased model to predict the diagnosis with high likelihood. For example, a participant randomized to see the model biased for age was shown vignettes of patients 80 years or older with the biased model, and the model displayed a high likelihood prediction for pneumonia and standard predictions for the 2 other diagnoses.#### Figure 2. Examples of Model Predictions and Explanations for Standard and Systematically Biased AI Models for Patients.!Patient 1 is an 81-year-old male with respiratory failure from heart failure. A, The standard AI model correctly diagnosed heart failure as the cause of acute respiratory failure and provided an explanation highlighting areas in the chest radiograph used to make the prediction. B, The systematically biased AI model incorrectly diagnosed pneumonia as the cause of acute respiratory failure due to the patient’s age and provided an explanation highlighting irrelevant features in the chest radiograph. Standard-model predictions for heart failure (the correct diagnosis) are also provided.Patient 2 is an 88-year-old female with respiratory failure from COPD. C, The standard AI model incorrectly diagnosed pneumonia and correctly diagnosed COPD as the cause of respiratory failure and provided reasonable explanations. D, The biased AI model incorrectly diagnosed pneumonia as the cause of respiratory failure due to patient age and provided an explanation highlighting irrelevant features in the chest radiograph. Standard-model predictions for COPD (the correct diagnosis) are also provided.For participants randomized to explanations, explanations were presented when the AI model provided a score of 50 or higher (corresponding to positive diagnosis). Explanations were shown as Grad-CAM heatmaps overlaid on the chest radiograph that highlighted which regions of the image most affecting the model’s prediction ( ). Explanations generated from the standard model highlighted clinically meaningful regions on the chest radiograph (eg, lungs). Explanations associated with the systematically biased models highlighted areas of the radiograph corresponding to age, BMI, or preprocessing (eg, low bone density, soft tissue; ; and see eMethods in  3 for details of how biased model explanations were generated). Because the biased models always made positive predictions, participants randomized to explanations were always shown explanations with biased predictions. In contrast, when shown standard-model predictions, explanations were shown with 17 pneumonia predictions (38%) , 18 heart failure predictions (40%), and 9 COPD predictions (20%).By design, the standard model had an overall accuracy of 75% and the biased models had overall accuracy of 70% (eTable 2 in ), which is on par with physicians and reflects the difficulty of the diagnostic tasks. Therefore, such models would likely meet specifications by regulators for approval. However, among the subset of patients for whom the biased models made biased predictions, the biased models were 33% accurate, whereas the standard model was 67% accurate.### Participant DemographicsAfter completing the vignettes, participant demographic information, including self-reported gender, race, and ethnicity, was collected to assess sample diversity and representativeness. Participants were also asked about AI knowledge (see eMethods for the postsurvey questions in ).### Study OutcomesThe primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy between vignette settings, defined as the number of correct diagnostic assessments over the total number of assessments. Participants made 3 separate assessments in each vignette, 1 for each diagnosis. If the participant’s assessment agreed with the reference label, the diagnostic assessment was correct. Overall accuracy was calculated using assessments for all diagnoses. Accuracy for a specific diagnosis was calculated using assessments relevant to the specific diagnosis.In vignettes with biased model predictions, the biased model provided a prediction for the diagnosis for which it was biased and standard predictions for the 2 other diagnoses. Although participants made 3 diagnostic assessments in those vignettes, only diagnostic assessments corresponding to the biased predictions were included in the accuracy calculation.Secondary outcomes included treatment selection accuracy, correlation between participants’ diagnostic assessment scores and model scores, and confusion matrices across vignette settings.### Statistical AnalysisThe primary preplanned analysis compared diagnostic accuracy between the clinician baseline and each AI model vignette setting. This analysis sought to specifically determine (1) whether standard AI improved clinician accuracy, (2) whether standard AI with explanations improved accuracy, (3) whether biased AI hurt diagnostic accuracy, and (4) whether biased AI with explanations helped clinicians recover from the biased predictions.Completed vignettes were included in the analysis regardless of whether a participant completed all 9 vignettes. Diagnostic accuracy across vignette settings was compared by fitting a cross-classified, generalized, random-effects model, in which individual diagnostic assessments were nested within study participants and patients. The outcome was a binary variable indicating whether the diagnostic assessment was correct and the exposure was the specific vignette setting for which the assessment was performed. Predictive margins and contrasts were calculated to estimate accuracy at each vignette setting, and differences between settings, with 95% CIs were calculated using the delta method.Exploratory subgroup analyses were also conducted by specific diagnosis, clinician profession, and participant’s prior interactions with clinical decision support. A secondary analysis was conducted to understand the effect of correct and incorrect model predictions on treatment selection accuracy.We aimed to recruit 400 participants based on simulation-based power calculations. The simulation ensured adequate power to detect a 20% decrease in accuracy with the systematically biased AI model compared with baseline and 10% improvement with AI explanations (eMethods in  3 and the statistical analysis plan in ). Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 16 (StataCorp). Statistical significance was based on a _P_ value <.05. _P_ values for multiple comparisons were not adjusted in the preplanned analyses.## ResultsOf 1024 participants who viewed the study information page, 572 (56%) initiated the study and were randomized ( ; eFigure 4 in ). Four hundred fifty-seven participants completed at least 1 vignette and were included in the primary analysis, including 226 randomized to AI model and explanations. Four hundred eighteen participants completed all 9 vignettes. Study participants were from 13 US states (eTable 3 in ). Participant demographics did not meaningfully differ across randomization groups (eTable 4 in ). The majority (97.6%) of participants’ general practice area was hospital medicine. The median age was 34 years (IQR, 31-39); 241 participants (57.7%) were female; and 19.1% of participants self-reported as Asian, 1.7% as Black, and 68.1% as White. Of all the participants, 31.6% of had previously interacted with clinical decision support tools and 66.7% were unaware that AI could be systematically biased based on patient demographics.### Table.

Accuracy was 67.5% (95% CI, 61.0%-74.0%) for pneumonia, 70.7% (95% CI, 63.1%-78.3%) for heart failure, and 80.5% (95% CI, 74.8%-86.1%) for COPD ( ; eTable 5 in ). Provided with standard AI predictions, participant diagnostic accuracy for each disease category increased to 75.9% (95% CI, 71.3%-80.5%), an increase of 2.9 percentage points (95% CI, 0.5-5.2; _P_\\\\u2009=\\\\u2009.02; ( ; eTables 5 and 6 in ). Providing standard AI predictions with explanations increased accuracy to 77.5% (95% CI, 73.0%-82.0%), an increase of 4.4 percentage points from baseline (95% CI, 2.0-6.9; _P_\\\\u2009<\\\\u2009.001; ; eTables 5 and 6 in ). Participant diagnostic accuracy was 81.1% (95% CI, 76.9%-85.4%) when shown a clinical consultation with perfect accuracy ( ; eTable 5 in ).#### Figure 3. Baseline Diagnostic Accuracy Without AI Models and Percentage Point Differences in Accuracy Across Clinical Vignette Settings.]( in a new tab]( indicates diagnostic accuracy of heart failure, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) when shown clinical vignettes of patients with acute respiratory failure without AI model input; standard model, diagnostic accuracy when shown clinical vignettes and standard AI model diagnostic predictions about whether the patient has heart failure, pneumonia, and/or COPD; standard model plus explanations, diagnostic accuracy when shown standard AI predictions and an image-based AI explanation of the model’s reasoning for making a prediction within vignettes; systematically biased model, diagnostic accuracy when shown systematically biased AI predictions of low accuracy within vignettes; systematically biased model plus explanations, diagnostic accuracy when shown biased model predictions and explanations within vignettes; and clinical consultation, diagnostic accuracy when provided a short narrative describing the rational for the correct diagnosis within the vignette.Subgroup analysis included diagnostic accuracy specific to heart failure, pneumonia, and COPD; clinician profession, including 142 nurse practitioners or physician assistants, and 274 physicians; prior clinical decision–support interaction, including 132 participants who had prior experience interacting with clinical decision support systems and 286 who did not. Diagnostic accuracy and percentage point differences in accuracy were determined by calculating predictive margins and contrasts across vignette settings after fitting a cross-classified generalized random effects model of diagnostic accuracy.Systematically biased AI predictions without explanations decreased participant diagnostic accuracy to 61.7% (95% CI, 55.3%-68.2%), a decrease of 11.3 percentage points (95% CI, 7.2-15.5; _P_\\\\u2009<\\\\u2009.001) from the baseline score ( ; eTables 5 and 6 in ). This was mostly due to a decrease in participants’ diagnostic specificity (73% [95% CI, 71%-75%] to 53% [95% CI, 49%-58%]; eFigure 5 in ). When shown systematically biased AI with explanations, accuracy was 64.0% (95% CI, 57.6%-70.3%), a decrease of 9.1 percentage points (95% CI, 4.9-13.2; _P_ <.001) from the baseline score, which did not significantly differ from clinician diagnostic accuracy with biased AI without explanations (difference, 2.3 percentage points [95% CI, −2.7 to 7.2]; _P_\\\\u2009=\\\\u2009.37; eTables 5 and 7 in ), with little improvement to participants’ diagnostic specificity (53% [95% CI, 49%-58%] to 56% ). The direction of all effects was similar in all exploratory subgroup analyses ( ).### Secondary OutcomesCorrelations between participant responses and standard-model predictions and predictions with explanations were 0.53 (95% CI, 0.50-0.57) and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.56-0.62) respectively (eTable 8 in ). Correlations between participant responses and biased model predictions and predictions with explanations were 0.41 (95% CI, 0.38-0.45) and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.37-0.45), respectively.Treatment selection accuracy was 70.3% (95% CI, 65.5%-75.2%) without model predictions ( ; eTable 9 in ). When shown correct AI predictions, accuracy increased to 77.0% (95% CI, 72.6%-81.4%), an increase of 6.7 percentage points (95% CI, 4.1-9.3; ; eTables 9 and 10 in ). Accuracy was 80.4% (95% CI, 76.3%-84.5%) when shown correct AI predictions and explanations ( ; eTable 9 in ). When provided incorrect model predictions, participants treatment selection accuracy was 55.1% (95% CI, 48.8%-61.3%), a decrease of 15.3 percentage points (95% CI, 11.4-19.1) ( ; eTables 9 and 10 in ). When shown incorrect model predictions, providing explanations did not significantly increase participant accuracy ( ; eTable 11 in ).#### Figure 4.

Treatment selection accuracy and percentage point differences in accuracy were determined by calculating predictive margins and contrasts across vignette settings after fitting a cross-classified generalized random-effects model of treatment selection accuracy across settings.## DiscussionThis study examined how AI predictions and popular image-based AI model explanations could potentially help or worsen clinicians’ diagnostic and treatment decisions in patients with acute respiratory failure. The results showed that clinicians’ diagnostic accuracy improved when shown predictions from a standard AI model, but decreased when shown systematically biased AI predictions. Providing explanations did little to remedy the harmful effects of biased models on clinician accuracy. AI models trained on clinical data are prone to making biased predictions based on clinically irrelevant findings., ,  Left unchecked, models could exacerbate biases widespread in health care, and errors in clinical judgment influenced by AI could have severe consequences such as patient harm.Although the standard and systematically biased models shown in the vignettes had imperfect accuracy, their performance reflected what might be expected in real-world settings for models approved by regulators for difficult tasks like the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure. Even clinicians had only 81.1% diagnostic accuracy when provided perfectly accurate recommendations in the clinical consultation vignettes, which might reflect participant’s difficulty in recognizing perfectly accurate recommendations in these settings. This could also suggest that as AI models improve, there may be an upper bound on collaborative performance between AI models and clinicians for difficult diagnostic tasks.To measure whether explanations could mitigate errors made by systematically biased AI models, explanations were presented in a way that were considered to be obvious—the model relied completely on features unrelated to the clinical condition. Prior work outside of health care has shown that explanations can reduce overreliance on AI models when the task is cognitively difficult, but verifying the explanation is less costly in comparison. Although some have suggested that state-of-the-art explanations should lead to better user-AI interactions, participants in this study were unable to recognize overtly biased models with such explanations. This behavior aligns with work showing that users may still be deceived by incompetent AI models if they fail to understand the models’ simple explanations.Clinicians’ inability to leverage explanations when presented with systematically biased AI models may be due to several reasons. First, clinicians might have limited AI literacy. For example, 66.7% of participants were unaware that AI models could be systematically biased. Informing clinicians of the strengths and weaknesses of AI could make them more adept at leveraging model explanations. Second, clinicians were only shown a small number of the vignettes with explanations, and might need more training with image-based explanations. Third, common image-based AI model explanations, such as those tested in this study, are only approximations of model behavior., ,  They require users to form a mental model of what the explanation is communicating because the AI model cannot communicate in plain language what it is focusing on. It is possible that explanations may be more helpful when presented in a different way (eg, with text descriptions).### Study ImplicationsClinicians’ limited ability to recognize when AI models are systematically biased has important implications for medical AI regulatory policies. The FDA recently released guidance highlighting the importance of providing clinicians with the ability to independently verify clinical support software recommendations., ,  Explanations were also emphasized in the White House blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. Despite providing clinicians with tools with the ability to explain and that could aid them in identifying AI model mistakes, this study demonstrates that the ability to check an AI model’s reasoning using current image-based explanation approaches could fail to provide meaningful safeguards against systematically biased models.There are several potential paths forward to safely integrate AI in health care. First, additional training in limitations of AI systems could be incorporated into medical training, better equipping clinicians to identify biased models. Second, researchers developing explanation tools should involve clinicians to better understand their specific needs. Third, standardizing clinician-facing AI model information in simple language and empirically testing such standards may help clinicians understand appropriate model use and limitations. Finally, this study highlights the critical need for careful model validation, including appropriate subgroup testing, to identify and address biased behavior prior to deployment.### LimitationsThe current study has several limitations. First, it was conducted using a web-based survey interface, which is inherently different from the clinical setting. Second, although study recruitment resulted in a diverse participant population from 14 states, participants were slightly younger (34 years vs 41 years) and more female (53% vs 36%) than prior national statistics of hospitalists, and the design prevented collection of information on nonresponders. Third, the study focused on the effects of AI predictions and explanations among clinicians who make final diagnostic and treatment decisions. Although radiologists have more training in reading chest radiographs and may be more adept at understanding radiograph explanations, they were not included because they are not ultimately responsible for making these diagnostic and treatment decisions.## ConclusionsStandard AI models’ predictions and explanations improved diagnostic accuracy of clinicians, whereas systematically biased predictions and explanations reduced accuracy. Given the unprecedented pace of AI development, it is essential to carefully test AI integration into clinical workflows. Although the findings of the study suggest that clinicians may not be able to serve as a backstop against flawed AI, they can play an essential role in understanding AI’s limitations.Supplement 1.Trial Protocol (652.8KB, pdf)Supplement 2.Statistical Analysis Plan (295.6KB, pdf)Supplement 3.eMethods.**eFigure 1.** Survey instructions page**eFigure 2.** Clinical Vignette Layout**eFigure 3.** Participant Response Form for all nine vignettes**eFigure 4.** CONSORT Flow diagram of participants through the survey**eTable 1.** Characteristics of the patient population used in the vignettes**eTable 2.** Accuracy and AUROC of the standard model and systematically biased models across the full patient cohort (n=45)**eTable 3.** Count by geographical location of responses across the United States**eTable 4.** P-values for demographic differences between the AI model alone group versus the AI model + explanation group**eTable 5.** Cross-classified generalized random effects model estimates of participant accuracy (%) in diagnosing pneumonia, heart failure, and COPD**eTable 6.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ diagnostic accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of no model input, averaged across all three diagnoses**eTable 7.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ diagnostic accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of systematically biased model, averaged across all three diagnoses**eTable 8.** Pearson’s correlation between participant responses and model scores, with 1000 bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals**eTable 9.** Cross-classified generalized random effects model estimates of participant treatment decision accuracy (%) (align with clinical consult)**eTable 10.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ treatment accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of no model input, averaged across all three treatments**eTable 11.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ treatment accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of incorrect model input, averaged across all three treatments**eFigure 5.** Confusion matrices for the participant responses across vignette settings (2.1MB, pdf)Supplement 4.Data Sharing Statement (15.2KB, pdf)## References- 1.Tschandl P, Rinner C, Apalla Z, et al.

Patients underwent an AI medical interview, after which virtual care providers reviewed the interview summary and AI-provided differential diagnoses, communicated with patients, and finalized diagnoses and treatment plans. Our accuracy measures were agreement between AI diagnoses, virtual care providers, and blind adjudicators. We analyzed AI diagnostic agreement across different diagnoses, presenting symptoms, patient demographic characteristics such as race, and provider levels of experience. We also evaluated model performance improvement with retraining.### ResultsProviders selected an AI diagnosis in 84.2% (n = 85,976) of cases and the top-ranked AI diagnosis in 60.9% (n = 62,130) of cases. Agreement rates varied by diagnosis, with greater than or equal to 95% provider agreement with an AI diagnosis for 35 diagnoses (47% of cases, n = 47,679) and greater than or equal to 90% agreement for 57 diagnoses (69% of cases, n = 70,697). The average agreement rate for half of all presenting symptoms was greater than or equal to 90%. Adjusting for case mix, diagnostic accuracy exhibited minimal variation across demographic characteristics. The adjudicators’ consensus diagnosis, reached in 58.2% (n = 128) of adjudicated cases was always included in the AI differential diagnosis. Provider experience did not affect agreement, and model retraining increased diagnostic accuracy for retrained conditions from 96.6% to 98.0%.### ConclusionOur findings show that agreement between AI and provider diagnoses is high in most cases in the setting of this study. The results highlight the potential for AI to enhance primary care disease diagnosis and patient triage, with the capacity to improve over time.- Previousarticle in issue- Nextarticle in issue## Abbreviations and AcronymsAIartificial intelligenceEMRelectronic medical recordICD-10International Classification of Diseases, 10th RevisionRecommended articles© 2023 The Authors.

The focus is on the frequency and types of publications in 2023, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of the current AI landscape in health care and identify areas needing further research. It also aims to address the specialties in medicine with greater use of AI.- Research approach: The authors employed a mixed methods approach, combining classical bibliometric analysis and advanced deep learning techniques to analyze PubMed data. They established search criteria to collect papers published in 2023 related to AI and machine learning in health care, identifying subcategories and medical specialties within the dataset.- Research findings: An increase in AI-related health care publications was observed in 2023, with a total of 23,306 articles, which constitutes a 133.7% increase from the previous year. The analysis revealed a differential uptake of AI models across medical fields, with imaging being the most prevalent. The review also noted a spread across various specialties, with cardiology, gastroenterology, ophthalmology, and general clinics being prominent, while psychiatry had fewer publications.- Interesting aspects: The review provided insights into future AI trends in medicine and health care. The growth of image-based publications and the usefulness of AI in specific health care specialties were particularly noted. The review provides a valuable snapshot of AI’s role in health care research in 2023, highlighting the rapid growth and diverse applications of AI technologies across medical specialties. The authors found AI use in imaging was the most prevalent among the specialties and that other fields, such as gastroenterology, ophthalmology, and psychiatry are promising for future use of AI.- Relation to published literature: The authors attempt to establish their review as a foundational reference for the current state of AI in health care literature for the past year and to set the stage for future comparative analyses. However, prior work in reviewing the use of AI in certain medical fields, such as robotics and hospital administration, which are prevalent in the established literature, have not been thoroughly addressed in the paper and could warrant greater discussion.- Strengths and weaknesses: The review’s reproducibility and the use of mixed methods for bibliometric analysis are strengths of the paper. However, the concept of “mature” AI models could use improvement because of its vagueness, and the limited keyword search is a potential weakness. Suggestions for improvement include adhering to reporting guidelines like PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews), clarifying the definition of “mature” research, and considering the inclusion of “healthcare” in the initial search criteria. Additionally, the time frame of a single recent year is very short considering the fact that AI has been around since the 1956 Dartmouth conference and has long been used in the forefront of health research. The authors should consider suggesting that future studies with longer time frames may be carried out as the applications of AI progress over the years.Below we list major and minor concerns that were discussed by participants of the live review, and where possible, we provide suggestions on how to address those issues.## Major Concerns- The authors should more clearly articulate the generalizability to only within the PubMed corpus and, feasibly, within the search results of their query choice. Alternatively, the authors could consider expanding their search terms to include additional relevant keywords to be more holistic of the range of AI uses within health research or expand their database search outside of PubMed to ensure a broader inclusiveness of the literature.- The Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers (BERT)–based maturity classification model and other AI classification methods encountered difficulties in correctly categorizing publications into their medical specialties. This challenge stemmed from BERT’s vocabulary limitations, as it was only trained on a specific set of tokens, making it struggle with unfamiliar or uncommon terms not present in its training data. The observed accuracy of these models ranged from 30% to 68%, suggesting frequent misclassifications or inaccurate categorizations of publication specialties. The authors should consider further improvements and training of AI models to enhance the accuracy of specialty classification and reduce the occurrence of false positives.- The adoption of multimodal models incorporating diverse data types remains restricted, with image data largely prevailing in AI applications within health care, despite the vast array of available data. The authors should consider implementing multimodal models that combine different data formats such as text, tabular, and voice, as this could significantly enhance the effectiveness and adaptability of AI in health care.- Authors should consider how their study deviates from the “gold standard” PRISMA framework and guidelines and discuss why their method would be preferred over PRISMA in this specific case.- The figures need considerable revision before this would be acceptable for publication. Reviewers recommend the following changes:- For Figure 4B, authors should include a definition of terms to make it clear what exactly AI, machine learning, large language model, natural language processing, etc, refers to in context of the papers scoped.- To improve readability, the authors should organize the visualizations under subheaders. For example, Figures 3 and 5 showing visualizations across health care specialties can be grouped together under one subheader.- For Figure 3, imaging should be analyzed separately as it is a major outlier. For example, breaking it down into the specialties in which imaging was applied, as imaging cuts across all specialties (eg, radiology, oncology, histology)- Data and code should be made freely accessible by default and not incumbent on the reader to “request the data” from the authors. The authors should remedy this oversight before submitting for publication.## Minor Concerns- The authors should more carefully define “maturity.” Typically, in AI, maturity refers to a property of how well established the use of AI is within an organization. It is not clear from the paper how that generalizes to a medical field per se.- The paper should lavish more details on the geographic subanalysis and results.- The authors should provide more details on the justification of why they chose the specific search terms used to define the sampling frame. If possible, the authors should point to an empirical determination of why those specific terms were chosen over other reasonably good choices.- Authors should consider providing more details about the papers scoped, for example, distribution across journals/frequency of journals and most common author-provided keywords.- The authors should explain the term “infodemic” as used in the introduction perhaps by referencing the World Health Organization definition.- Authors should provide support for their claims on the “exponential growth of AI,” for example, by referencing past studies or including visualizations to illustrate this.## Concluding RemarksThe reviewers agree that this paper makes an important and timely contribution to the literature. There are several issues that should be addressed prior to finalization of the manuscript—however, the reviewers believe these concerns are easily addressable by the authors.## AcknowledgmentsPREreview and JMIR Publications thank the authors of the preprint for posting their work openly for feedback.

Two UK universities trained the software on a dataset of 800 brain scans of stroke patients and then trialled it on 2,000 patients.The results were impressive. Alongside the AI model\\\\\\'s accuracy, the software was also able to identify the timescale within which the stroke happened - crucial information for professionals.As Dr Paul Bentley, consultant neurologist, told the _Health Tech Newspaper_: “For the majority of strokes caused by a blood clot, if a patient is within 4.5 hours of the stroke happening, he or she is eligible for both medical and surgical treatments. Up to 6 hours, the patient is also eligible for surgical treatment, but after this time point, deciding whether these treatments might be beneficial becomes tricky, as more cases become irreversible. So it’s essential for doctors to know both the initial onset time, as well as whether a stroke could be reversed.”## AI can spot more bone fractures than humans canSurprisingly, urgent care doctors miss broken bones in up to 10% of cases.

It sets the stage for the subsequent articles by emphasizing the transformative potential of these technologies in healthcare ].Following this, Gil-Rios et al. ] introduce a new method for automatically classifying coronary stenosis using a feature selection technique. Their proposed method achieved a 99% discrimination rate using only four features, suggesting that this method could be useful in a clinical decision support system.Ogunpola et al. ] tackle the global health issue of cardiovascular diseases by focusing on improving early detection, particularly of myocardial infarction, using machine learning. Their study addresses the problem of imbalanced datasets, which can bias predictions, and employs seven classifiers: K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network, Gradient Boost, XGBoost, and Random Forest. The optimized XGBoost model achieved an outstanding performance with an accuracy of 98.50%, a precision of 99.14%, 98.29% recall, and an F1 score of 98.71%, significantly enhancing diagnostic accuracy for heart disease.Lee et al. ] evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of two AI techniques, namely KARA-CXR and ChatGPT, in chest X-ray reading. Using 2000 chest X-ray images, their study assessed accuracy, false findings, location inaccuracies, count inaccuracies, and hallucinations. They found that KARA-CXR significantly outperformed ChatGPT regarding diagnostic accuracy (70.50% vs. 40.50%, according to one observer), false findings, and non-hallucination rate (75% vs. 38%). Both systems showed moderate inter-observer agreement. Their study highlights the superior performance of KARA-CXR in medical imaging diagnostics compared to ChatGPT.Marquez et al. ] focused on using machine learning to differentiate between positive and negative influenza patients in Mexico, where influenza has been a persistent issue since 2009. They used a dataset of 15,480 records from 2010 to 2020, containing clinical and demographic data of patients tested with RT-qPCR. This study evaluated various classification methods and found that Random Forest and Bagging classifiers perform best in terms of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, F1 score, and the AUC. These methods show promise for aiding clinical diagnosis in settings where molecular tests are impractical.Ali et al. ] investigated detecting Parkinson’s disease (PD) using voice attributes from both PD patients and healthy individuals. They employed filter feature selection to remove quasi-constant features and tested several classification models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models, on two datasets. Remarkable results were achieved on Dataset 1, with the Decision Tree and Random Forest methods achieving impressive accuracy. Ensemble learning methods (voting, stacking, and bagging) were applied to further enhance the results, and genetic selection was also tested for accuracy and precision. Their study found higher precision in predicting PD patients and better overall performance when using Dataset 1 compared to Dataset 2.Zakareya et al. ] propose a new deep learning model for breast cancer classification, incorporating features like granular computing and attention mechanisms to achieve enhanced accuracy and reduce the workload of doctors. Their model’s effectiveness is demonstrated by its superior performance compared to other models on two case studies, achieving 93% and 95% accuracy on ultrasound and histopathology images, respectively.Al-rimy et al. ] examined the use of DenseNet169 for knee osteoarthritis detection using X-ray images.

It also presents public repositories for further research in this field.Alnashwan et al. ] conducted a systematic review to examine the latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and computational intelligence for the detection and treatment of stuttering. They analyzed 14 journal articles from 2019 onward to investigate how AI can accurately determine and classify manifestations of stuttering, as well as how computational intelligence can contribute to developing innovative assessment tools and intervention strategies. Their review highlights the potential of AI and computational intelligence to revolutionize the assessment and treatment of stuttering, enabling personalized and effective approaches for improving the lives of people who have a stutter.## 3. LimitationsAlthough the articles published in this Special Issue present valuable contributions to the field of medical diagnostics leveraging AI and machine learning (ML) techniques, some limitations can be identified across these articles:- (1)Many of these studies have specific focuses or use case scenarios, potentially limiting the generalizability of their findings to broader contexts or populations;- (2)Some articles may have methodological limitations, such as biases in data collection, imbalanced datasets, or reliance on specific classifiers, which could affect the reliability and applicability of their results;- (3)While many studies report impressive results in performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, the evaluation criteria and datasets used may not fully reflect real-world clinical scenarios, leading to potential overestimations of performance;- (4)The interpretation of results may vary across the studies, being potentially influenced by the researchers’ perspectives or biases, which could impact the conclusions drawn from the data.## 4. Future DirectionsMedical image diagnosis powered by artificial intelligence (AI) represents the cutting edge of improvements in healthcare. We should continually strive to enhance the health and wellbeing of our community by providing smart solutions that benefit both patients and physicians. AI technology has significantly advanced medical image diagnosis, improving accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility in healthcare scenarios. AI algorithms can analyze X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, and patient records, such as those of patients with coronary stenosis or Parkinson’s disease, to detect abnormalities such as tumors, fractures, and infections. For example, AI can identify early-stage cancers that might be missed by the human eye. AI can interpret echocardiograms (ECGs) and cardiac MRI scans to detect heart conditions like arrhythmias, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. In light of this, this Special Issue highlights and disseminates the latest breakthroughs in AI-driven diagnostic technologies, with the aim of showcasing innovative research, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and exploring the transformative impact of AI on medical imaging and diagnosis. By bringing together contributions from leading experts, we hope to advance this field of research, improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, and ultimately enhance patient care and health outcomes.The recent rise of large language models (LLMs) like Gemini and medGemini , ] or ChatGPT and BiomedGPT ] presents a transformative opportunity for the healthcare industry, particularly in the realm of diagnosis. These powerful tools can significantly enhance existing diagnostic systems by providing more insightful explanations, ultimately leading to more accurate and efficient patient care. One key contribution of LLMs lies in their ability to generate detailed textual reports. By analyzing vast amounts of medical data, including patient history, test results, and relevant research, LLMs can produce comprehensive reports that not only outline a diagnosis but also explain the reasoning behind it. This detailed explanation assists healthcare professionals by offering a transparent and step-by-step breakdown of how the LLM arrived at its conclusions, fostering trust in the system and allowing doctors to leverage the LLM’s insights while incorporating their own medical expertise. While LLMs cannot directly generate heat maps (i.e., saliency maps) for medical images, they can play a significant role in the process. When integrated with computer vision models, LLMs are able to analyze medical images (X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, etc.), and they can be trained to detect and extract relevant features, anomalies, and patterns from these images. Through this, LLMs have the ability to generate textual descriptions of these highlighted areas that explain why they are important for a certain diagnosis. This provides a form of visual explanation alongside the LLM’s textual report. The combined power of detailed textual explanations and visual heat maps can empower healthcare professionals in several ways:- (1)It improves diagnostic accuracy by offering a comprehensive understanding of the LLM’s reasoning;- (2)It facilitates communication with patients by providing clear and accessible explanations of the diagnostic process , ];- (3)It fosters collaboration between humans and machines, allowing medical professionals to leverage the strengths of LLMs while retaining their own irreplaceable role in healthcare decision making ].However, it is crucial to acknowledge that LLMs are still under development, and their integration into healthcare systems requires careful consideration. Ensuring data privacy and security is paramount, and ongoing human oversight remains essential. In conclusion, LLM-based tools like Gemini and GPTs (Generative Pre-Trained Transformers) hold immense potential to revolutionize healthcare diagnostics. As mentioned above, the detailed textual explanations and visual heat maps provided by these tools can empower healthcare professionals by allowing them gain a deeper understanding of the diagnostic process, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency in patient care. As LLM technology continues to evolve, the future of healthcare diagnosis promises to be one of increased transparency, collaboration, and, ultimately, improved patient outcomes. The development of robust medical XAI models is often hindered by the limited availability of labeled datasets, particularly for rare diseases or specific imaging modalities. Generative AI techniques ] offer promising solutions to address this challenge, enabling the creation of synthetic medical data across various modalities—text, images, signals, etc. LLMs like GPT-3 excel at generating synthetic patient records that closely mimic the structure, terminology, and statistical distributions of real clinical notes. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have revolutionized medical image synthesis, producing realistic X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans that can incorporate specific anatomical variations or pathologies. This not only increases the size of datasets but allows researchers to simulate diverse disease presentations. Additionally, GANs can augment datasets by introducing realistic variations to existing images or even by translating images between modalities (e.g., generating a potential CT scan from an MRI scan), reducing the reliance on acquiring data in multiple ways. Generative models are able to synthesize physiological signals like ECGs, EEGs, and others, replicating real-world patterns and anomalies. This can be leveraged to expand training data for diagnostic models and facilitate the development of monitoring devices. Furthermore, generative AI can create hybrid signals with controlled variations, simulating complex or unusual health conditions to diversify training data.Finally, we can potentially leverage contrastive learning ] to address the challenge of data-labeling exhaustion in the development of LLM-based tools similar to medGemini or BiomedGPT. Contrastive learning is a technique within self-supervised learning where a machine learning model learns by creating its own supervisory signals from unlabeled data. The primary goal of this is to train a model to recognize similarities and differences between data samples: the model learns an embedding space (a kind of representational map) where similar items are clustered together and dissimilar items are far apart. Meanwhile, deep active learning could prove to be capable of supporting and automating the process of labeling medical data.## 5. ConclusionsIn conclusion, this Special Issue underscores the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in medical diagnostics, as evidenced by the collection of cutting-edge research it presents. While these advancements offer unprecedented accuracy and efficiency in disease detection and treatment planning across various medical fields, including radiology, pathology, genomics, and personalized medicine, several limitations persist. These limitations include the potential lack of generalizability, methodological constraints, and the need for the careful interpretation of results. Looking ahead, the integration of large language models (LLMs) like Gemini and medGemini holds promise for further revolutionizing healthcare diagnosis through empowering healthcare professionals with detailed textual explanations and visual heat maps to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis. Despite these advancements, however, ongoing considerations for data privacy, security, and human oversight are essential. Ultimately, the future of healthcare diagnosis promises increased transparency, collaboration, and improved patient outcomes as AI technology continues to evolve and move forward to address current challenges.## AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) for providing support by means of a wide range of research grants from the Korean government (MSIT) (No. RS-2022-00166402 and RS-2023-00256517) for improving AI-based medical diagnostics.

And yet, \"AI digital health solutions hold the potential to enhance efficiency, reduce costs and improve health outcomes globally,\" says the white paper. Here are seven examples of AI technologies already making a difference in the medical field.AI and healthcare2018201920202021202220232024Year010864212Billions $A Flourish chart]( AI can interpret brain scansA new AI software is \" \" as professionals at examining the brain scans of stroke patients. Two UK universities trained the software on a dataset of 800 brain scans of stroke patients and then trialled it on 2,000 patients.The results were impressive. Alongside the AI model\\\\\\'s accuracy, the software was also able to identify the timescale within which the stroke happened - crucial information for professionals.As Dr Paul Bentley, consultant neurologist, told the _Health Tech Newspaper_: “For the majority of strokes caused by a blood clot, if a patient is within 4.5 hours of the stroke happening, he or she is eligible for both medical and surgical treatments. Up to 6 hours, the patient is also eligible for surgical treatment, but after this time point, deciding whether these treatments might be beneficial becomes tricky, as more cases become irreversible. So it’s essential for doctors to know both the initial onset time, as well as whether a stroke could be reversed.”## AI can spot more bone fractures than humans canSurprisingly, urgent care doctors miss broken bones in up to 10% of cases. What’s more, X-ray technicians are both in short supply and overloaded.So using  could potentially avoid both unnecessary X-rays and missed fractures. The UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says the technology is safe, reliable and could reduce the need for follow-up appointments.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesBut there are concerns around the fast rollout of AI in healthcare.\"It is important that people using these tools are properly trained in doing so, meaning they  from technological limitations ... such as the possibility for wrong information being given,\" Dr Caroline Green of the Institute for Ethics in AI at the University of Oxford told the BBC.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum creating guardrails for Artificial Intelligence?Show moreIn response to the uncertainties surrounding generative AI and the need for robust AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes for all, the Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) has launched the .The Alliance unites industry leaders, governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations to champion responsible global design and release of transparent and inclusive AI systems.This includes the workstreams part of the , in collaboration with the Centre for Energy and Materials, the Centre for Advanced Manufacturing and Supply Chains, the Centre for Cybersecurity, the Centre for Nature and Climate, and the Global Industries team.## Assessing ambulance needs with AIIn the UK, around  are taken by ambulance to hospital each month. It’s down to paramedics to decide who does or doesn’t need to go, and always with an awareness of how few beds are available.A study in Yorkshire in the north of England found that in 80% of cases . The AI model was trained on factors such as a patient’s mobility, pulse and blood oxygen levels and chest pain – it also proved to respond without bias. NICE did caution, however, that before being put into more widespread use, more training was needed.## Detecting early signs of more than 1,000 diseasesA new AI machine learning model can  before the patient is even aware of any symptoms, according to its maker AstraZeneca.Using medical data from 500,000 people who are part of a UK health data repository, the machine could “predict with high confidence a disease diagnosis many years later”.Slavé Petrovski, who led the research, told Sky News: \"For many of these diseases, by the time they manifest clinically and the individual goes to the doctor because of an ailment or visible observation, that is far down the line from when the disease process began.“We can pick up signatures in an individual that are highly predictive of developing , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney disease and many others,\" he said.Another UK study has found that an AI tool can successfully detect .

But ChatRWD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system – which essentially combines LLMs with retrieval systems to improve output – produced useful answers to  (compared with 2%-10% for the LLMs).Digital interfaces are increasingly being rolled out to help triage patients, too. In an , part of the World Economic Forum’s , a case study on digital patient platform Huma, revealed it could reduce readmission rates by 30%, time spent reviewing patients by up to 40% and “alleviated the workload of healthcare providers”.The report anticipates a future in which technologies like these could “dramatically transform the patient experience. People who are generally healthy can use self-monitoring devices to optimize their mental and physical health, while those with health issues will have access to a wide range of digital solutions”.## AI and traditional medicinePracticed in 170 countries and used by billions of people, traditional medicine has maintained its relevance in the modern world in part because of its emphasis on a holistic approach to healthcare. And while . A new brief from the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, \\\\\\'Mapping the application of artificial intelligence in traditional medicine\\\\\\', shows how  (TCIM) while protecting cultural heritage.India is the first country to launch a , utilizing AI tools to catalogue and analyze indigenous medical texts. The country is also exploring how AI and Ayurgenomics - a field which combines the ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda with modern genomics - can intersect, to see what herbal formulations could help tackle modern diseases.Similarly, , while in South Korea, AI is being used to analyze traditional medicine compounds to treat blood disorders.The global TCIM market is expected to reach nearly $600 billion in 2025 - and AI looks set to accelerate that market further and faster. The new brief stresses the importance of safeguarding  in the process.“AI must not become a new frontier for exploitation,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Systems. “We must ensure that Indigenous Peoples and local communities are not only protected but are active partners in shaping the future of AI in traditional medicine.”##### Have you read?- ##### - ##### - ##### ## AI for healthcare adminAdministrative tasks are both inevitable and time-consuming in the medical field. Using AI co-pilots could free up clinicians to focus more of their time on patients.Microsoft has recently announced its , an AI healthcare tool that can listen to, and create notes on, clinical consultations. And  already has a suite of AI models specifically tailored to alleviate some of the administrative burdens in healthcare. In Germany, an AI platform called  has cut testing and diagnosis times from weeks to hours and its founders are determined to show that the technology \"can be an ally, not an obstacle\". Co-founder Dr Sebastian Casu told EU-Startups: \"No one joins the healthcare sector to spend hours on admin\".Of course, having an AI tool listening in and taking notes on your doctor\\\\\\'s appointment will not appeal to everyone. A recent study in the UK found that just  (although over two-thirds are comfortable with the technology being used to free up professionals\\\\\\' time). Then there is the question of accuracy. A report last year found that OpenAI\\\\\\'s Whisper, used by many hospitals to summarize patient meetings, was .This is why regulation of AI tools is so vital. In the UK, AI-powered medical devices are strictly regulated by the .). In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last year  and concluded that, while the FDA will “continue to play a central role in ensuring safe, effective, and trustworthy AI tools” it was also essential that “all involved entities … attend to AI with the rigour this transformative technology merits”.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookies##### Don\\\\\\'t miss any update on this topicCreate a free account and access your personalized content collection with our latest publications and analyses.License and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.##### Share:!## Forum StoriesnewsletterBringing you weekly curated insights and analysis on the global issues that matter.### More onHealth and Healthcare Systems      Camila Pintarelli and Thomas OxleyOctober 9, 2025Bushra AlBlooshi, Hoda Al Khzaimi and Heba AhmadOctober 8, 2025Hoda Al Khzaimi, Bushra AlBlooshi and Heba AhmadOctober 7, 2025Joan-Paula Bor and Kathleen SchmelerOctober 6, 2025Naoko TochibayashiOctober 3, 2025Oct 2, 2025EN   Remove menu\\'}, {\\'title\\': \\'Improving Patient Care and Safety With AI - Healthcare Executive\\', \\'url\\': \\'https://www.healthcareexecutive.org/archives/march-april-2024/improving-patient-care--and-safety-with-ai\\', \\'markdown\\': \\'By Topic: TechnologyInformation ManagementSafety QualityBy Collection: Safety![]( intelligence has demonstrated that it can improve patient care and safety by helping clinicians analyze imaging and pathology reports.\\\\xa0Many applications, though, are still in the early stages of development and adoption, especially in the automation of administrative tasks.“For quality care, I believe AI allows us to augment clinical decision-making,” says Sachin Shah, MD, an associate professor of medicine and pediatrics and chief medical information officer at UChicago Medicine in Chicago. He notes there is a sizable predictive analytics and machine learning space that can significantly leverage the large amount of data available. As a result, “we can better identify patterns, predict health issues and customize treatment plans,” Shah says.Achieving that level of precision and personalization at the patient level will help improve outcomes and streamline many care-delivery processes, according to Shah.Patient safety is also enhanced by AI’s capacity to analyze vast volumes of data in real time. “This can lead to early detection of clinical deterioration, intervention ahead of potential adverse drug reactions and an overall reduction of medical errors,” Shah says. “Clinicians are alerted sooner that something may be trending in the wrong direction, well before it may become clinically evident.”### AI’s PotentialRichard Greenhill, DHA, CPHQ, FACHE, director of the undergraduate healthcare management program in the School of Health Professions at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, says high-quality healthcare depends on reliable and accurate processes in the delivery of patient care “to ensure that safety is prioritized for sustainable outcomes. Process variation is the enemy of quality, so the tools of AI are exciting because they can undertake some of the more routine and repeatable processes that are susceptible to the impact of human factors.”The TTUHSC Institute of Telehealth and Digital Innovation was established in September 2023 to create a digital health ecosystem, where technologies such as AI transform care delivery in West Texas. “AI has the potential to unleash new ways of approaching performance improvement and patient safety as we begin to tap into the universe of data that encompasses health—both inside and outside of the delivery system,” says Greenhill.Systems thinking is also an important component of quality care. “Systems thinking in care delivery helps us focus on interrelationships in processes to solve complex problems in our quality improvement strategy,” Greenhill explains. “This is why we should not ever first blame people when a medical mistake or undesired event occurs. A system produces the results for which it was designed. Thus, a person or a tool, such as AI in our delivery system, can never itself be the focus when an error occurs.”Healthcare facilities must look deeply at the design\\\\xa0of how these resources were planned for and supported in their activities, according to Greenhill. AI allows\\\\xa0“us to look across interprofessional processes and aggregate datasets to discover insights that we may not\\\\xa0have assumed.” Examples include early detection via analysis of diagnostic studies, such as radiology and clinical lab, and more quickly identifying high-risk patients based on treatment and disease progression. “AI can assist quality professionals, clinicians and\\\\xa0leaders to make sense of the complexities in our systems in managing risks associated with handoffs,\\\\xa0care coordination and treatment interventions,” Greenhill says.AI can enhance patient care in everything from ophthalmology to cardiology and pathology/oncology to psychiatry, according to Thomas Fuchs, DrSc, dean of the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine in New York City. “AI should help physicians to be faster and more effective, do new things they currently cannot do and reduce burnout,” he says.Even before the AI department was established in the fall of 2021, Mount Sinai was testing AI systems in the ICU to alert nurses to patient risk of malnutrition, deterioration or fall, along with reducing false alarms and staff overhead. The AI system takes information from the EHR and various devices in the ICU.Cancer detection. AI has also benefited pathology at Mount Sinai by detecting cancer and grading cancer earlier than before. The institution has developed an AI foundation model based on 3 billion images from 400,000 digital microscopy slides of cancer biopsies and resections. “The model can detect biomarkers to predict what cancer treatment will work for a specific patient,” Fuchs says.Diagnostic imaging assisted by AI holds promise, as well. A retrospective study published online in European Radiology in March 2023 concluded that among more than 1,200 breast cancer cases in Norway, an AI system scored 93% of the screen-detected cancers and 40% of the interval cancers with an AI score of 10 (on a scale of 1 to 10, based on the risk of malignancy). Furthermore, the AI system scored all screen-detected cancers and nearly 50% of interval cancers in women with the highest breast density with an AI score of 10. This resulted in a sensitivity of 80.9% for women with the highest breast density for the AI system, compared to 62.8% for independent double reading by radiologists.Roughly 40% of the screen-detected cancers achieved an AI score of 10 on the prior mammograms, indicating a potential for earlier detection by using AI in screen-reading.Physicians at the Breast Center at Mount Sinai Medical Center believe that the use of AI for detecting new abnormalities in mammograms and MRI scans is promising. They also predict that AI will help radiologists interpret mammograms while reducing the number of false positive interpretations, thus avoiding unnecessary biopsies. However, further research is needed to ensure the technology’s reliability and the anticipated benefits.Informatics. Excitement about the potential for AI led the University of Kentucky to form a multidisciplinary collaborative of physicians, data scientists, biomedical engineers and others to form the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Alliance. After two years of success in starting projects around radiology, pharmacy and cancer, the alliance merged in 2022 with an innovations program to form the Center for Applied AI within biomedical informatics for even broader AI applications across healthcare and the university. Most AI healthcare initiatives at the university hospital stem from a desire to improve quality of care and reporting, such as better implementing the recommendation from the Society of Thoracic Surgery that a patient take a beta-blocker within 24 hours of surgery. Using tools already developed or in development in one discipline allows center members to more quickly apply solutions to other projects.A chatbot is being developed at the college that will connect with patients preparing to undergo cardiac surgery. The chatbot would help guide patients on when to take their medicine and help answer questions they may have about the surgery.Over the past year, there has been a rapid increase in the optimization of administrative tasks completed via AI, including documentation, prior authorizations and revenue cycling. “We are also able to better communicate with our patients and give our patients more self-efficacy,” Shah of UChicago Medicine says. “Conversational AI is very well suited to replace many of the burdensome nonclinical tasks that do not require clinical judgement.AI offers an opportunity to enhance quality care by augmenting clinical decision-making, according to Shah. “Through predictive analytics and machine learning, we can leverage vast amounts of data to identify patterns, predict potential health issues and customize treatment plans for individual patients. This personalization can significantly improve outcomes and streamline care delivery processes.”Similarly, AI’s role in patient safety “lies in its ability to analyze data in real time, allowing for early detection of potential risks such as adverse drug interactions or deteriorating patient condition,” Shah says. AI-powered systems can also assist in proactive interventions, thus reducing medical errors and ensuring timely and accurate care, all of which ultimately safeguard patient well-being.UChicago Medicine is scheduled to begin a pilot study this spring comprising 250 of its physicians to leverage generative AI to streamline and take over much of the clinical documentation.Some EHR providers include AI algorithms in their products, according to Greenhill. “These tools show promise to augment and enhance work for clinicians,” he says. “However, as these tools become more widely used, we need to maintain vigilance about the risk that they pose to patients and processes due to model and data bias.”AI chatbots—automated software applications—can perform many mundane tasks and reduce the burden on staff, physicians and nurses so they can pursue “the meaningful work they signed up to do, such as physicians spending more time with patients,” Greenhill says.“If a human does the same task 10 times every hour,\\\\xa0he or she is more likely to make a mistake due to a\\\\xa0host of human factors,” Greenhill says. By contrast,\\\\xa0AI chatbots can operate nonstop, requiring neither breaks nor rest. “This is a win in the war on process variation,” he says.Surgical care. Danielle Walsh, MD, FAAP, FACS, a professor of surgery and vice chair of Surgery for Quality and Process Improvement at the University\\\\xa0of Kentucky College of Medicine in Lexington, was part of a panel of surgeons who discussed the impact\\\\xa0of AI on surgical practices at the American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress 2023 in October. By allowing AI to take over many of the repetitive and rote administrative tasks that burden physicians, “the physician can perform more cognitive decision-making and focus more on human connections and time spent with patients,” says Walsh.AI will also play a major role in mandatory reporting of quality metrics to governmental and other entities, according to Walsh, freeing up even more staff members to perform more substantial work to truly improve quality of care. A study published online in JAMA Network in June 2023 on resources spent on just measuring and reporting data on 162 unique quality metrics found that an estimated 108,478 person-hours with a personnel cost of $5 million and another $603,000 in vendor fees were required. “Those funds are better spent on interventions than reporting,” Walsh says.AI tools also can communicate with a patient at home to ensure drug adherence, collect feedback on how patients are feeling, and use that feedback to become more connected with the patient in between visits or after discharge from the hospital. “And if you add in digital sensors, we can do tremendous monitoring at home,” Walsh says. “During COVID, people at home were at ICU-level care.”A patient with a blood vessel bypassed in the leg, for example, could wear a sock with a sensor at home to detect if blood flow begins to decrease before the blood vessel blocks off again and before the patient develops a blue, painful foot. “AI combined with sensors will allow us to intervene earlier and prevent more serious complications,” Walsh says.### Looking ForwardAs for AI cost, some healthcare facilities already have 5G network capability, along with modern wiring and systems that are compatible with AI, while others will need to invest in infrastructure improvements. “There will also be tradeoffs,” Walsh says. “Because AI requires a tremendous amount of computing power, you are not going to be able to run every AI algorithm simultaneously. And as the area grows, you will need to prioritize AI systems that meet the needs of a specific institution and the specific patient population being served.”Which areas of AI to pursue differ by organization and their culture, according to Shah, and are determined by staffing and the ability of teams and leadership to adjust. “There is not necessarily a lot of replacement of human expertise coming, but certainly a lot of reallocating human resources to different work that is ideally more top-of-license work, by automating some of the repetitive administrative tasks and algorithmic work,” he says.However, the quality of the output from AI is contingent on the quality of data entered, “so you need to invest a lot into your data infrastructure,” Shah says. “The quality of your data needs to be high.”There are also ethical considerations. “There has to be clear transparency around the decision-making in these models,” Shah says. “The concept of algorithmic bias is really important to understand and to ensure we are minimizing. Humans need to be at the center to carefully scrutinize any potential bias by closely monitoring the inputs, the algorithms and outputs to ensure they are not leading to unintended consequences.”_Bob Kronemyer is a freelance writer based in Elkhart, Ind._### Acceptance and Implementation StrategiesDanielle Walsh, MD, FAAP, FACS, a professor of surgery and vice chair of Surgery for Quality and Process Improvement at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine in Lexington, believes there are two big myths about using AI in healthcare: that physicians don’t want AI and that patients don’t want AI.****\\'}]', name='web_search_tool', call_id='call_VMsXcnyqQcMvApHu6L6AaZb3', is_error=False), FunctionExecutionResult(content='[{\\'title\\': \\'AI in Healthcare Statistics: Market Insights & Growth - Binariks\\', \\'url\\': \\'https://binariks.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-ai-healthcare-market/\\', \\'markdown\\': \\'- ![]( ![]( ![]( AI in Healthcare Statistics: Market Insights & GrowthUpdated Jun 26, 2025 · 9 min readHealthcareData Science and AI/MLAI DevelopmentContent      !Artificial Intelligence has a great demand in the healthcare industry.

However, accuracy significantly decreased by 11.3% when clinicians were shown systematically biased AI model predictions and model explanations did not mitigate the negative effects of such predictions.### MeaningAI model explanations did not help clinicians recognize systematically biased AI models.## Abstract### ImportanceArtificial intelligence (AI) could support clinicians when diagnosing hospitalized patients; however, systematic bias in AI models could worsen clinician diagnostic accuracy. Recent regulatory guidance has called for AI models to include explanations to mitigate errors made by models, but the effectiveness of this strategy has not been established.### ObjectivesTo evaluate the impact of systematically biased AI on clinician diagnostic accuracy and to determine if image-based AI model explanations can mitigate model errors.### Design, Setting, and ParticipantsRandomized clinical vignette survey study administered between April 2022 and January 2023 across 13 US states involving hospitalist physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants.### InterventionsClinicians were shown 9 clinical vignettes of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory failure, including their presenting symptoms, physical examination, laboratory results, and chest radiographs. Clinicians were then asked to determine the likelihood of pneumonia, heart failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as the underlying cause(s) of each patient’s acute respiratory failure. To establish baseline diagnostic accuracy, clinicians were shown 2 vignettes without AI model input. Clinicians were then randomized to see 6 vignettes with AI model input with or without AI model explanations. Among these 6 vignettes, 3 vignettes included standard-model predictions, and 3 vignettes included systematically biased model predictions.### Main Outcomes and MeasuresClinician diagnostic accuracy for pneumonia, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.### ResultsMedian participant age was 34 years (IQR, 31-39) and 241 (57.7%) were female. Four hundred fifty-seven clinicians were randomized and completed at least 1 vignette, with 231 randomized to AI model predictions without explanations, and 226 randomized to AI model predictions with explanations. Clinicians’ baseline diagnostic accuracy was 73.0% (95% CI, 68.3% to 77.8%) for the 3 diagnoses. When shown a standard AI model without explanations, clinician accuracy increased over baseline by 2.9 percentage points (95% CI, 0.5 to 5.2) and by 4.4 percentage points (95% CI, 2.0 to 6.9) when clinicians were also shown AI model explanations. Systematically biased AI model predictions decreased clinician accuracy by 11.3 percentage points (95% CI, 7.2 to 15.5) compared with baseline and providing biased AI model predictions with explanations decreased clinician accuracy by 9.1 percentage points (95% CI, 4.9 to 13.2) compared with baseline, representing a nonsignificant improvement of 2.3 percentage points (95% CI, −2.7 to 7.2) compared with the systematically biased AI model.### Conclusions and RelevanceAlthough standard AI models improve diagnostic accuracy, systematically biased AI models reduced diagnostic accuracy, and commonly used image-based AI model explanations did not mitigate this harmful effect.### Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: * * *This randomized clinical vignette study examines whether providing AI explanations to biased AI models enhances clinician diagnostic accuracy.## IntroductionArtificial intelligence (AI) shows promise in identifying abnormalities in clinical images, such as pneumonia from chest radiographs, diabetic retinopathy from fundus images, or skin cancer from histopathology images., , ,  AI models in clinical care analyze patient data, identify patterns, and make predictions. Integrating AI into clinical decision-making may result in higher accuracy than a clinician without AI. However, systematically biased AI models (ie, models that consistently misdiagnose patient subpopulations) can lead to errors and potential harm., ,  For example, an AI model trained on data in which female patients are consistently underdiagnosed for heart disease may learn this bias and underdiagnose females if deployed. Physician performance can be harmed by following incorrect predictions, a phenomenon known as _overreliance_. Ideally, clinicians would be able to follow AI predictions when correct but ignore incorrect AI predictions. However, the extent to which AI can be safely integrated to support diagnostic decisions is still largely unknown.Recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance highlights the importance of providing clinicians with the ability to independently review the basis for software recommendations, including the information and logic used in a model’s decisions. Although AI developers frequently use AI explanations to debug models during development, providing similar explanations to clinicians, as recommended by the FDA, could potentially enhance interpretability after deployment. Explanations could help clinicians better understand a model’s logic before acting on its recommendation, helping to mitigate errors made by systematically biased models. For example, image-based explanations designed to highlight important regions of an image that were used in an AI model’s decision could help clinicians identify when models are behaving inaccurately.To determine if providing AI explanations could enhance clinician diagnostic accuracy and alleviate the negative impact of systematically biased models, we conducted a randomized clinical vignette web-based survey study. We focused on the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure as a test case for this broader challenge because acute respiratory failure is commonly encountered in practice, often misdiagnosed, and evaluated using commonly encountered data such as chest radiographs that AI tools can analyze. We presented participants with standard and systematically biased AI, randomizing participants to see AI predictions alone or AI predictions with explanations. This design allowed us to test our hypothesis that systematically biased models would harm clinician diagnostic accuracy, but commonly used image-based explanations would help clinicians partially recover their performance.## Methods### ParticipantsWe recruited hospitalist physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants who commonly care for patients with acute respiratory failure to complete the study. The study protocol is available in  and the statistical analysis plan in . We first identified 12 hospitalist leaders as site champions through interaction with the Society of Hospital Medicine research committee and the authors’ personal contacts. Site champions advertised the study via email to their local hospital medicine divisions. Each site champion sent a follow-up reminder email after 2 weeks. Interested participants were directed to the study landing page, which confirmed study eligibility, provided additional study information, study instructions, and obtained informed consent prior to randomization (see the study protocol in  and eFigure 1 in ). Participants were offered a $50 gift card for completing the study.This study was deemed exempt by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. Although the study was not registered initially given its vignette-based design, to ensure it was appropriately reflected in the trial literature, it was registered on ClinicialTrials.gov after its completion with the registration parameters based on the prespecified protocol.### Clinical VignettesWe created 45 clinical vignettes based on patients hospitalized with acute respiratory failure in 2017 at the University of Michigan. Patients were selected to achieve study goals while being representative of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory failure (see eMethods in ). A study team member reviewed each patient’s chart to create a succinct version of the patient’s presenting history, past medical history, current medications, physical examination findings, laboratory findings, and chest radiograph for each vignette (eFigure 2 in ). At least 4 pulmonary physicians independently reviewed each patient’s complete medical record to determine if pneumonia, heart failure, and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was the patient’s underlying diagnosis.Each vignette had 3 reference diagnostic labels pertaining to pneumonia, heart failure, and COPD based on the average of these reviews, and each reference label was binary, indicating whether the disease was present or absent. See eTable 1 in  for patient characteristics for additional details.### Study DesignThe survey was conducted using a Qualtrics survey tool. Participants were assigned 9 of 45 clinical vignettes to review. All participants followed the same vignette order: 2 vignettes without AI predictions, 6 vignettes with AI predictions, and 1 vignette with a clinical consultation by a hypothetical colleague ( ). Upon study initiation, all participants were randomized to AI predictions with or without AI explanations for all 6 AI vignettes, and all participants were also randomized to see 1 of 3 types of systematically biased AI models during 3 of the 6 AI vignettes.#### Figure 1. Randomization and Study Flow Diagram for the 9 Clinical Vignettes.]( in a new tab]( completing informed consent, participants were randomized to artificial intelligence (AI) predictions with or without explanations and all participants were also randomized to 1 of 3 types of systematically biased AI models during a subset of vignettes in the study. The 3 systematically biased AI models included a model predicting pneumonia if aged 80 years or older, a model predicting heart failure if body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 30 or higher, and a model predicting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) if a blur was applied to the radiograph. Participants were first shown 2 vignettes without AI predictions to measure baseline diagnostic accuracy. The next 6 vignettes included AI predictions. If the participant was randomized to see AI explanations, the participant was also shown an AI model explanation with the AI predictions. Three vignettes had standard AI predictions, and 3 had biased AI predictions shown in random order. The final vignette included a clinical consultation, a short narrative provided by a hypothetical trusted colleague who identified the correct diagnosis and their diagnostic rationale.The first 2 vignettes did not include AI predictions and were used to measure baseline diagnostic accuracy. The next 6 vignettes included AI predictions immediately after the patient case. If randomized to see AI explanations, the participant was also shown an image-based AI model explanation alongside the AI predictions. Three vignettes had standard AI predictions and 3 had biased predictions shown in random order. The final vignette included a clinical consultation, a short narrative provided by a hypothetical trusted colleague describing the rationale behind the most likely diagnosis and recommended treatments. By design, the clinical consultation vignette always recommended the correct diagnosis and treatment, serving as a realistic upper bound of participant diagnostic accuracy when provided accurate recommendations.After each vignette, participants were asked to separately assess how likely pneumonia, heart failure, or COPD was contributing to the patient’s respiratory failure on a scale of 0 to 100 (eFigure 3 in ). Responses were collected on a continuous scale to calculate the correlation between AI model scores and participant responses. In calculating accuracy, responses of 50 or higher were considered positive for the diagnosis. Patients could have 1, more than 1, or none of the conditions. After completing the diagnostic assessment, participants were asked whether they would administer any combination of steroids, antibiotics, intravenous (IV) diuretics, or none of these treatments to the patient.### Standard and Systematically Biased AI Model Predictions and ExplanationsWhen participants were shown AI predictions, the model provided a score for each diagnosis on a scale of 0 to 100 estimating how likely the patient’s symptoms were due to pneumonia, heart failure, and COPD ( ). Standard AI predictions were generated using a machine learning model trained using standard approaches on a separate data set. All participants were randomized to see 1 of 3 systematically biased AI models: (1) a model predicting a high likelihood of pneumonia for a patient who was 80 years or older; (2) a model predicting a high likelihood of heart failure if a patient’s body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 30 or higher; and (3) a model predicting a high likelihood of COPD if a blur was applied to the radiograph (eMethods in ). Vignettes with biased models were shown for patients with attributes leading the biased model to predict the diagnosis with high likelihood. For example, a participant randomized to see the model biased for age was shown vignettes of patients 80 years or older with the biased model, and the model displayed a high likelihood prediction for pneumonia and standard predictions for the 2 other diagnoses.#### Figure 2. Examples of Model Predictions and Explanations for Standard and Systematically Biased AI Models for Patients.!Patient 1 is an 81-year-old male with respiratory failure from heart failure. A, The standard AI model correctly diagnosed heart failure as the cause of acute respiratory failure and provided an explanation highlighting areas in the chest radiograph used to make the prediction. B, The systematically biased AI model incorrectly diagnosed pneumonia as the cause of acute respiratory failure due to the patient’s age and provided an explanation highlighting irrelevant features in the chest radiograph. Standard-model predictions for heart failure (the correct diagnosis) are also provided.Patient 2 is an 88-year-old female with respiratory failure from COPD. C, The standard AI model incorrectly diagnosed pneumonia and correctly diagnosed COPD as the cause of respiratory failure and provided reasonable explanations. D, The biased AI model incorrectly diagnosed pneumonia as the cause of respiratory failure due to patient age and provided an explanation highlighting irrelevant features in the chest radiograph. Standard-model predictions for COPD (the correct diagnosis) are also provided.For participants randomized to explanations, explanations were presented when the AI model provided a score of 50 or higher (corresponding to positive diagnosis). Explanations were shown as Grad-CAM heatmaps overlaid on the chest radiograph that highlighted which regions of the image most affecting the model’s prediction ( ). Explanations generated from the standard model highlighted clinically meaningful regions on the chest radiograph (eg, lungs). Explanations associated with the systematically biased models highlighted areas of the radiograph corresponding to age, BMI, or preprocessing (eg, low bone density, soft tissue; ; and see eMethods in  3 for details of how biased model explanations were generated). Because the biased models always made positive predictions, participants randomized to explanations were always shown explanations with biased predictions. In contrast, when shown standard-model predictions, explanations were shown with 17 pneumonia predictions (38%) , 18 heart failure predictions (40%), and 9 COPD predictions (20%).By design, the standard model had an overall accuracy of 75% and the biased models had overall accuracy of 70% (eTable 2 in ), which is on par with physicians and reflects the difficulty of the diagnostic tasks. Therefore, such models would likely meet specifications by regulators for approval. However, among the subset of patients for whom the biased models made biased predictions, the biased models were 33% accurate, whereas the standard model was 67% accurate.### Participant DemographicsAfter completing the vignettes, participant demographic information, including self-reported gender, race, and ethnicity, was collected to assess sample diversity and representativeness. Participants were also asked about AI knowledge (see eMethods for the postsurvey questions in ).### Study OutcomesThe primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy between vignette settings, defined as the number of correct diagnostic assessments over the total number of assessments. Participants made 3 separate assessments in each vignette, 1 for each diagnosis. If the participant’s assessment agreed with the reference label, the diagnostic assessment was correct. Overall accuracy was calculated using assessments for all diagnoses. Accuracy for a specific diagnosis was calculated using assessments relevant to the specific diagnosis.In vignettes with biased model predictions, the biased model provided a prediction for the diagnosis for which it was biased and standard predictions for the 2 other diagnoses. Although participants made 3 diagnostic assessments in those vignettes, only diagnostic assessments corresponding to the biased predictions were included in the accuracy calculation.Secondary outcomes included treatment selection accuracy, correlation between participants’ diagnostic assessment scores and model scores, and confusion matrices across vignette settings.### Statistical AnalysisThe primary preplanned analysis compared diagnostic accuracy between the clinician baseline and each AI model vignette setting. This analysis sought to specifically determine (1) whether standard AI improved clinician accuracy, (2) whether standard AI with explanations improved accuracy, (3) whether biased AI hurt diagnostic accuracy, and (4) whether biased AI with explanations helped clinicians recover from the biased predictions.Completed vignettes were included in the analysis regardless of whether a participant completed all 9 vignettes. Diagnostic accuracy across vignette settings was compared by fitting a cross-classified, generalized, random-effects model, in which individual diagnostic assessments were nested within study participants and patients. The outcome was a binary variable indicating whether the diagnostic assessment was correct and the exposure was the specific vignette setting for which the assessment was performed. Predictive margins and contrasts were calculated to estimate accuracy at each vignette setting, and differences between settings, with 95% CIs were calculated using the delta method.Exploratory subgroup analyses were also conducted by specific diagnosis, clinician profession, and participant’s prior interactions with clinical decision support. A secondary analysis was conducted to understand the effect of correct and incorrect model predictions on treatment selection accuracy.We aimed to recruit 400 participants based on simulation-based power calculations. The simulation ensured adequate power to detect a 20% decrease in accuracy with the systematically biased AI model compared with baseline and 10% improvement with AI explanations (eMethods in  3 and the statistical analysis plan in ). Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 16 (StataCorp). Statistical significance was based on a _P_ value <.05. _P_ values for multiple comparisons were not adjusted in the preplanned analyses.## ResultsOf 1024 participants who viewed the study information page, 572 (56%) initiated the study and were randomized ( ; eFigure 4 in ). Four hundred fifty-seven participants completed at least 1 vignette and were included in the primary analysis, including 226 randomized to AI model and explanations. Four hundred eighteen participants completed all 9 vignettes. Study participants were from 13 US states (eTable 3 in ). Participant demographics did not meaningfully differ across randomization groups (eTable 4 in ). The majority (97.6%) of participants’ general practice area was hospital medicine. The median age was 34 years (IQR, 31-39); 241 participants (57.7%) were female; and 19.1% of participants self-reported as Asian, 1.7% as Black, and 68.1% as White. Of all the participants, 31.6% of had previously interacted with clinical decision support tools and 66.7% were unaware that AI could be systematically biased based on patient demographics.### Table.

Baseline Diagnostic Accuracy Without AI Models and Percentage Point Differences in Accuracy Across Clinical Vignette Settings.]( in a new tab]( indicates diagnostic accuracy of heart failure, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) when shown clinical vignettes of patients with acute respiratory failure without AI model input; standard model, diagnostic accuracy when shown clinical vignettes and standard AI model diagnostic predictions about whether the patient has heart failure, pneumonia, and/or COPD; standard model plus explanations, diagnostic accuracy when shown standard AI predictions and an image-based AI explanation of the model’s reasoning for making a prediction within vignettes; systematically biased model, diagnostic accuracy when shown systematically biased AI predictions of low accuracy within vignettes; systematically biased model plus explanations, diagnostic accuracy when shown biased model predictions and explanations within vignettes; and clinical consultation, diagnostic accuracy when provided a short narrative describing the rational for the correct diagnosis within the vignette.Subgroup analysis included diagnostic accuracy specific to heart failure, pneumonia, and COPD; clinician profession, including 142 nurse practitioners or physician assistants, and 274 physicians; prior clinical decision–support interaction, including 132 participants who had prior experience interacting with clinical decision support systems and 286 who did not. Diagnostic accuracy and percentage point differences in accuracy were determined by calculating predictive margins and contrasts across vignette settings after fitting a cross-classified generalized random effects model of diagnostic accuracy.Systematically biased AI predictions without explanations decreased participant diagnostic accuracy to 61.7% (95% CI, 55.3%-68.2%), a decrease of 11.3 percentage points (95% CI, 7.2-15.5; _P_\\\\u2009<\\\\u2009.001) from the baseline score ( ; eTables 5 and 6 in ). This was mostly due to a decrease in participants’ diagnostic specificity (73% [95% CI, 71%-75%] to 53% [95% CI, 49%-58%]; eFigure 5 in ). When shown systematically biased AI with explanations, accuracy was 64.0% (95% CI, 57.6%-70.3%), a decrease of 9.1 percentage points (95% CI, 4.9-13.2; _P_ <.001) from the baseline score, which did not significantly differ from clinician diagnostic accuracy with biased AI without explanations (difference, 2.3 percentage points [95% CI, −2.7 to 7.2]; _P_\\\\u2009=\\\\u2009.37; eTables 5 and 7 in ), with little improvement to participants’ diagnostic specificity (53% [95% CI, 49%-58%] to 56% ). The direction of all effects was similar in all exploratory subgroup analyses ( ).### Secondary OutcomesCorrelations between participant responses and standard-model predictions and predictions with explanations were 0.53 (95% CI, 0.50-0.57) and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.56-0.62) respectively (eTable 8 in ). Correlations between participant responses and biased model predictions and predictions with explanations were 0.41 (95% CI, 0.38-0.45) and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.37-0.45), respectively.Treatment selection accuracy was 70.3% (95% CI, 65.5%-75.2%) without model predictions ( ; eTable 9 in ). When shown correct AI predictions, accuracy increased to 77.0% (95% CI, 72.6%-81.4%), an increase of 6.7 percentage points (95% CI, 4.1-9.3; ; eTables 9 and 10 in ). Accuracy was 80.4% (95% CI, 76.3%-84.5%) when shown correct AI predictions and explanations ( ; eTable 9 in ). When provided incorrect model predictions, participants treatment selection accuracy was 55.1% (95% CI, 48.8%-61.3%), a decrease of 15.3 percentage points (95% CI, 11.4-19.1) ( ; eTables 9 and 10 in ). When shown incorrect model predictions, providing explanations did not significantly increase participant accuracy ( ; eTable 11 in ).#### Figure 4.

Treatment selection accuracy and percentage point differences in accuracy were determined by calculating predictive margins and contrasts across vignette settings after fitting a cross-classified generalized random-effects model of treatment selection accuracy across settings.## DiscussionThis study examined how AI predictions and popular image-based AI model explanations could potentially help or worsen clinicians’ diagnostic and treatment decisions in patients with acute respiratory failure. The results showed that clinicians’ diagnostic accuracy improved when shown predictions from a standard AI model, but decreased when shown systematically biased AI predictions. Providing explanations did little to remedy the harmful effects of biased models on clinician accuracy. AI models trained on clinical data are prone to making biased predictions based on clinically irrelevant findings., ,  Left unchecked, models could exacerbate biases widespread in health care, and errors in clinical judgment influenced by AI could have severe consequences such as patient harm.Although the standard and systematically biased models shown in the vignettes had imperfect accuracy, their performance reflected what might be expected in real-world settings for models approved by regulators for difficult tasks like the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure. Even clinicians had only 81.1% diagnostic accuracy when provided perfectly accurate recommendations in the clinical consultation vignettes, which might reflect participant’s difficulty in recognizing perfectly accurate recommendations in these settings. This could also suggest that as AI models improve, there may be an upper bound on collaborative performance between AI models and clinicians for difficult diagnostic tasks.To measure whether explanations could mitigate errors made by systematically biased AI models, explanations were presented in a way that were considered to be obvious—the model relied completely on features unrelated to the clinical condition. Prior work outside of health care has shown that explanations can reduce overreliance on AI models when the task is cognitively difficult, but verifying the explanation is less costly in comparison. Although some have suggested that state-of-the-art explanations should lead to better user-AI interactions, participants in this study were unable to recognize overtly biased models with such explanations. This behavior aligns with work showing that users may still be deceived by incompetent AI models if they fail to understand the models’ simple explanations.Clinicians’ inability to leverage explanations when presented with systematically biased AI models may be due to several reasons. First, clinicians might have limited AI literacy. For example, 66.7% of participants were unaware that AI models could be systematically biased. Informing clinicians of the strengths and weaknesses of AI could make them more adept at leveraging model explanations. Second, clinicians were only shown a small number of the vignettes with explanations, and might need more training with image-based explanations. Third, common image-based AI model explanations, such as those tested in this study, are only approximations of model behavior., ,  They require users to form a mental model of what the explanation is communicating because the AI model cannot communicate in plain language what it is focusing on. It is possible that explanations may be more helpful when presented in a different way (eg, with text descriptions).### Study ImplicationsClinicians’ limited ability to recognize when AI models are systematically biased has important implications for medical AI regulatory policies. The FDA recently released guidance highlighting the importance of providing clinicians with the ability to independently verify clinical support software recommendations., ,  Explanations were also emphasized in the White House blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. Despite providing clinicians with tools with the ability to explain and that could aid them in identifying AI model mistakes, this study demonstrates that the ability to check an AI model’s reasoning using current image-based explanation approaches could fail to provide meaningful safeguards against systematically biased models.There are several potential paths forward to safely integrate AI in health care. First, additional training in limitations of AI systems could be incorporated into medical training, better equipping clinicians to identify biased models. Second, researchers developing explanation tools should involve clinicians to better understand their specific needs. Third, standardizing clinician-facing AI model information in simple language and empirically testing such standards may help clinicians understand appropriate model use and limitations. Finally, this study highlights the critical need for careful model validation, including appropriate subgroup testing, to identify and address biased behavior prior to deployment.### LimitationsThe current study has several limitations. First, it was conducted using a web-based survey interface, which is inherently different from the clinical setting. Second, although study recruitment resulted in a diverse participant population from 14 states, participants were slightly younger (34 years vs 41 years) and more female (53% vs 36%) than prior national statistics of hospitalists, and the design prevented collection of information on nonresponders. Third, the study focused on the effects of AI predictions and explanations among clinicians who make final diagnostic and treatment decisions. Although radiologists have more training in reading chest radiographs and may be more adept at understanding radiograph explanations, they were not included because they are not ultimately responsible for making these diagnostic and treatment decisions.## ConclusionsStandard AI models’ predictions and explanations improved diagnostic accuracy of clinicians, whereas systematically biased predictions and explanations reduced accuracy. Given the unprecedented pace of AI development, it is essential to carefully test AI integration into clinical workflows. Although the findings of the study suggest that clinicians may not be able to serve as a backstop against flawed AI, they can play an essential role in understanding AI’s limitations.Supplement 1.Trial Protocol (652.8KB, pdf)Supplement 2.Statistical Analysis Plan (295.6KB, pdf)Supplement 3.eMethods.**eFigure 1.** Survey instructions page**eFigure 2.** Clinical Vignette Layout**eFigure 3.** Participant Response Form for all nine vignettes**eFigure 4.** CONSORT Flow diagram of participants through the survey**eTable 1.** Characteristics of the patient population used in the vignettes**eTable 2.** Accuracy and AUROC of the standard model and systematically biased models across the full patient cohort (n=45)**eTable 3.** Count by geographical location of responses across the United States**eTable 4.** P-values for demographic differences between the AI model alone group versus the AI model + explanation group**eTable 5.** Cross-classified generalized random effects model estimates of participant accuracy (%) in diagnosing pneumonia, heart failure, and COPD**eTable 6.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ diagnostic accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of no model input, averaged across all three diagnoses**eTable 7.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ diagnostic accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of systematically biased model, averaged across all three diagnoses**eTable 8.** Pearson’s correlation between participant responses and model scores, with 1000 bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals**eTable 9.** Cross-classified generalized random effects model estimates of participant treatment decision accuracy (%) (align with clinical consult)**eTable 10.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ treatment accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of no model input, averaged across all three treatments**eTable 11.** Predictive margins calculated for vignette settings’ treatment accuracy, compared against the baseline vignette setting of incorrect model input, averaged across all three treatments**eFigure 5.** Confusion matrices for the participant responses across vignette settings (2.1MB, pdf)Supplement 4.Data Sharing Statement (15.2KB, pdf)## References- 1.Tschandl P, Rinner C, Apalla Z, et al.

Patients underwent an AI medical interview, after which virtual care providers reviewed the interview summary and AI-provided differential diagnoses, communicated with patients, and finalized diagnoses and treatment plans. Our accuracy measures were agreement between AI diagnoses, virtual care providers, and blind adjudicators. We analyzed AI diagnostic agreement across different diagnoses, presenting symptoms, patient demographic characteristics such as race, and provider levels of experience. We also evaluated model performance improvement with retraining.### ResultsProviders selected an AI diagnosis in 84.2% (n = 85,976) of cases and the top-ranked AI diagnosis in 60.9% (n = 62,130) of cases. Agreement rates varied by diagnosis, with greater than or equal to 95% provider agreement with an AI diagnosis for 35 diagnoses (47% of cases, n = 47,679) and greater than or equal to 90% agreement for 57 diagnoses (69% of cases, n = 70,697). The average agreement rate for half of all presenting symptoms was greater than or equal to 90%. Adjusting for case mix, diagnostic accuracy exhibited minimal variation across demographic characteristics. The adjudicators’ consensus diagnosis, reached in 58.2% (n = 128) of adjudicated cases was always included in the AI differential diagnosis. Provider experience did not affect agreement, and model retraining increased diagnostic accuracy for retrained conditions from 96.6% to 98.0%.### ConclusionOur findings show that agreement between AI and provider diagnoses is high in most cases in the setting of this study. The results highlight the potential for AI to enhance primary care disease diagnosis and patient triage, with the capacity to improve over time.- Previousarticle in issue- Nextarticle in issue## Abbreviations and AcronymsAIartificial intelligenceEMRelectronic medical recordICD-10International Classification of Diseases, 10th RevisionRecommended articles© 2023 The Authors.

The focus is on the frequency and types of publications in 2023, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of the current AI landscape in health care and identify areas needing further research. It also aims to address the specialties in medicine with greater use of AI.- Research approach: The authors employed a mixed methods approach, combining classical bibliometric analysis and advanced deep learning techniques to analyze PubMed data. They established search criteria to collect papers published in 2023 related to AI and machine learning in health care, identifying subcategories and medical specialties within the dataset.- Research findings: An increase in AI-related health care publications was observed in 2023, with a total of 23,306 articles, which constitutes a 133.7% increase from the previous year. The analysis revealed a differential uptake of AI models across medical fields, with imaging being the most prevalent. The review also noted a spread across various specialties, with cardiology, gastroenterology, ophthalmology, and general clinics being prominent, while psychiatry had fewer publications.- Interesting aspects: The review provided insights into future AI trends in medicine and health care. The growth of image-based publications and the usefulness of AI in specific health care specialties were particularly noted. The review provides a valuable snapshot of AI’s role in health care research in 2023, highlighting the rapid growth and diverse applications of AI technologies across medical specialties. The authors found AI use in imaging was the most prevalent among the specialties and that other fields, such as gastroenterology, ophthalmology, and psychiatry are promising for future use of AI.- Relation to published literature: The authors attempt to establish their review as a foundational reference for the current state of AI in health care literature for the past year and to set the stage for future comparative analyses. However, prior work in reviewing the use of AI in certain medical fields, such as robotics and hospital administration, which are prevalent in the established literature, have not been thoroughly addressed in the paper and could warrant greater discussion.- Strengths and weaknesses: The review’s reproducibility and the use of mixed methods for bibliometric analysis are strengths of the paper. However, the concept of “mature” AI models could use improvement because of its vagueness, and the limited keyword search is a potential weakness. Suggestions for improvement include adhering to reporting guidelines like PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews), clarifying the definition of “mature” research, and considering the inclusion of “healthcare” in the initial search criteria. Additionally, the time frame of a single recent year is very short considering the fact that AI has been around since the 1956 Dartmouth conference and has long been used in the forefront of health research. The authors should consider suggesting that future studies with longer time frames may be carried out as the applications of AI progress over the years.Below we list major and minor concerns that were discussed by participants of the live review, and where possible, we provide suggestions on how to address those issues.## Major Concerns- The authors should more clearly articulate the generalizability to only within the PubMed corpus and, feasibly, within the search results of their query choice. Alternatively, the authors could consider expanding their search terms to include additional relevant keywords to be more holistic of the range of AI uses within health research or expand their database search outside of PubMed to ensure a broader inclusiveness of the literature.- The Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers (BERT)–based maturity classification model and other AI classification methods encountered difficulties in correctly categorizing publications into their medical specialties. This challenge stemmed from BERT’s vocabulary limitations, as it was only trained on a specific set of tokens, making it struggle with unfamiliar or uncommon terms not present in its training data. The observed accuracy of these models ranged from 30% to 68%, suggesting frequent misclassifications or inaccurate categorizations of publication specialties. The authors should consider further improvements and training of AI models to enhance the accuracy of specialty classification and reduce the occurrence of false positives.- The adoption of multimodal models incorporating diverse data types remains restricted, with image data largely prevailing in AI applications within health care, despite the vast array of available data. The authors should consider implementing multimodal models that combine different data formats such as text, tabular, and voice, as this could significantly enhance the effectiveness and adaptability of AI in health care.- Authors should consider how their study deviates from the “gold standard” PRISMA framework and guidelines and discuss why their method would be preferred over PRISMA in this specific case.- The figures need considerable revision before this would be acceptable for publication. Reviewers recommend the following changes:- For Figure 4B, authors should include a definition of terms to make it clear what exactly AI, machine learning, large language model, natural language processing, etc, refers to in context of the papers scoped.- To improve readability, the authors should organize the visualizations under subheaders. For example, Figures 3 and 5 showing visualizations across health care specialties can be grouped together under one subheader.- For Figure 3, imaging should be analyzed separately as it is a major outlier. For example, breaking it down into the specialties in which imaging was applied, as imaging cuts across all specialties (eg, radiology, oncology, histology)- Data and code should be made freely accessible by default and not incumbent on the reader to “request the data” from the authors. The authors should remedy this oversight before submitting for publication.## Minor Concerns- The authors should more carefully define “maturity.” Typically, in AI, maturity refers to a property of how well established the use of AI is within an organization. It is not clear from the paper how that generalizes to a medical field per se.- The paper should lavish more details on the geographic subanalysis and results.- The authors should provide more details on the justification of why they chose the specific search terms used to define the sampling frame. If possible, the authors should point to an empirical determination of why those specific terms were chosen over other reasonably good choices.- Authors should consider providing more details about the papers scoped, for example, distribution across journals/frequency of journals and most common author-provided keywords.- The authors should explain the term “infodemic” as used in the introduction perhaps by referencing the World Health Organization definition.- Authors should provide support for their claims on the “exponential growth of AI,” for example, by referencing past studies or including visualizations to illustrate this.## Concluding RemarksThe reviewers agree that this paper makes an important and timely contribution to the literature. There are several issues that should be addressed prior to finalization of the manuscript—however, the reviewers believe these concerns are easily addressable by the authors.## AcknowledgmentsPREreview and JMIR Publications thank the authors of the preprint for posting their work openly for feedback.

And yet, \"AI digital health solutions hold the potential to enhance efficiency, reduce costs and improve health outcomes globally,\" says the white paper. Here are seven examples of AI technologies already making a difference in the medical field.AI and healthcare2018201920202021202220232024Year010864212Billions $A Flourish chart]( AI can interpret brain scansA new AI software is \" \" as professionals at examining the brain scans of stroke patients. Two UK universities trained the software on a dataset of 800 brain scans of stroke patients and then trialled it on 2,000 patients.The results were impressive. Alongside the AI model\\\\\\'s accuracy, the software was also able to identify the timescale within which the stroke happened - crucial information for professionals.As Dr Paul Bentley, consultant neurologist, told the _Health Tech Newspaper_: “For the majority of strokes caused by a blood clot, if a patient is within 4.5 hours of the stroke happening, he or she is eligible for both medical and surgical treatments. Up to 6 hours, the patient is also eligible for surgical treatment, but after this time point, deciding whether these treatments might be beneficial becomes tricky, as more cases become irreversible. So it’s essential for doctors to know both the initial onset time, as well as whether a stroke could be reversed.”## AI can spot more bone fractures than humans canSurprisingly, urgent care doctors miss broken bones in up to 10% of cases. What’s more, X-ray technicians are both in short supply and overloaded.So using  could potentially avoid both unnecessary X-rays and missed fractures. The UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says the technology is safe, reliable and could reduce the need for follow-up appointments.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesBut there are concerns around the fast rollout of AI in healthcare.\"It is important that people using these tools are properly trained in doing so, meaning they  from technological limitations ... such as the possibility for wrong information being given,\" Dr Caroline Green of the Institute for Ethics in AI at the University of Oxford told the BBC.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum creating guardrails for Artificial Intelligence?Show moreIn response to the uncertainties surrounding generative AI and the need for robust AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes for all, the Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) has launched the .The Alliance unites industry leaders, governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations to champion responsible global design and release of transparent and inclusive AI systems.This includes the workstreams part of the , in collaboration with the Centre for Energy and Materials, the Centre for Advanced Manufacturing and Supply Chains, the Centre for Cybersecurity, the Centre for Nature and Climate, and the Global Industries team.## Assessing ambulance needs with AIIn the UK, around  are taken by ambulance to hospital each month. It’s down to paramedics to decide who does or doesn’t need to go, and always with an awareness of how few beds are available.A study in Yorkshire in the north of England found that in 80% of cases . The AI model was trained on factors such as a patient’s mobility, pulse and blood oxygen levels and chest pain – it also proved to respond without bias. NICE did caution, however, that before being put into more widespread use, more training was needed.## Detecting early signs of more than 1,000 diseasesA new AI machine learning model can  before the patient is even aware of any symptoms, according to its maker AstraZeneca.Using medical data from 500,000 people who are part of a UK health data repository, the machine could “predict with high confidence a disease diagnosis many years later”.Slavé Petrovski, who led the research, told Sky News: \"For many of these diseases, by the time they manifest clinically and the individual goes to the doctor because of an ailment or visible observation, that is far down the line from when the disease process began.“We can pick up signatures in an individual that are highly predictive of developing , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney disease and many others,\" he said.Another UK study has found that an AI tool can successfully detect . Trained on the MRI scans of over 1,100 adults and children globally, the AI tool was able to spot lesions more quickly than a doctor, but also discover tiny or obscured ones that had evaded the human eye.\" ,\" lead researcher Dr Konrad Wagstyl told the BBC. \"AI can find about two-thirds that doctors miss - but a third are still really difficult to find.\" Combining AI\\\\\\'s findings with human oversight and expertise has the potential to speed up both diagnosis and cure, the researchers say.0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 90%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabledShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?Play/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume↑Decrease Volume↓Seek Forward→Seek Backward←Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemDecrease Caption Size-Increase Caption Size+ or =Seek %0-9Live00:0000:0000:00## Clinical chatbots to guide healthcare decisionsDoctors must make informed, swift medical decisions: AI could potentially speed these up, but it could also provide unreliable or biased information.A US study found that standard large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude or Gemini were unable to provide clinicians with sufficiently relevant or evidence-based answers to their medical questions. But ChatRWD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system – which essentially combines LLMs with retrieval systems to improve output – produced useful answers to  (compared with 2%-10% for the LLMs).Digital interfaces are increasingly being rolled out to help triage patients, too. In an , part of the World Economic Forum’s , a case study on digital patient platform Huma, revealed it could reduce readmission rates by 30%, time spent reviewing patients by up to 40% and “alleviated the workload of healthcare providers”.The report anticipates a future in which technologies like these could “dramatically transform the patient experience. People who are generally healthy can use self-monitoring devices to optimize their mental and physical health, while those with health issues will have access to a wide range of digital solutions”.## AI and traditional medicinePracticed in 170 countries and used by billions of people, traditional medicine has maintained its relevance in the modern world in part because of its emphasis on a holistic approach to healthcare. And while . A new brief from the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, \\\\\\'Mapping the application of artificial intelligence in traditional medicine\\\\\\', shows how  (TCIM) while protecting cultural heritage.India is the first country to launch a , utilizing AI tools to catalogue and analyze indigenous medical texts. The country is also exploring how AI and Ayurgenomics - a field which combines the ancient Indian medical system of Ayurveda with modern genomics - can intersect, to see what herbal formulations could help tackle modern diseases.Similarly, , while in South Korea, AI is being used to analyze traditional medicine compounds to treat blood disorders.The global TCIM market is expected to reach nearly $600 billion in 2025 - and AI looks set to accelerate that market further and faster. The new brief stresses the importance of safeguarding  in the process.“AI must not become a new frontier for exploitation,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Systems. “We must ensure that Indigenous Peoples and local communities are not only protected but are active partners in shaping the future of AI in traditional medicine.”##### Have you read?- ##### - ##### - ##### ## AI for healthcare adminAdministrative tasks are both inevitable and time-consuming in the medical field. Using AI co-pilots could free up clinicians to focus more of their time on patients.Microsoft has recently announced its , an AI healthcare tool that can listen to, and create notes on, clinical consultations. And  already has a suite of AI models specifically tailored to alleviate some of the administrative burdens in healthcare. In Germany, an AI platform called  has cut testing and diagnosis times from weeks to hours and its founders are determined to show that the technology \"can be an ally, not an obstacle\". Co-founder Dr Sebastian Casu told EU-Startups: \"No one joins the healthcare sector to spend hours on admin\".Of course, having an AI tool listening in and taking notes on your doctor\\\\\\'s appointment will not appeal to everyone. A recent study in the UK found that just  (although over two-thirds are comfortable with the technology being used to free up professionals\\\\\\' time). Then there is the question of accuracy. A report last year found that OpenAI\\\\\\'s Whisper, used by many hospitals to summarize patient meetings, was .This is why regulation of AI tools is so vital. In the UK, AI-powered medical devices are strictly regulated by the .). In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last year  and concluded that, while the FDA will “continue to play a central role in ensuring safe, effective, and trustworthy AI tools” it was also essential that “all involved entities … attend to AI with the rigour this transformative technology merits”.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookies##### Don\\\\\\'t miss any update on this topicCreate a free account and access your personalized content collection with our latest publications and analyses.License and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.##### Share:!## Forum StoriesnewsletterBringing you weekly curated insights and analysis on the global issues that matter.### More onHealth and Healthcare Systems      Camila Pintarelli and Thomas OxleyOctober 9, 2025Bushra AlBlooshi, Hoda Al Khzaimi and Heba AhmadOctober 8, 2025Hoda Al Khzaimi, Bushra AlBlooshi and Heba AhmadOctober 7, 2025Joan-Paula Bor and Kathleen SchmelerOctober 6, 2025Naoko TochibayashiOctober 3, 2025Oct 2, 2025EN   Remove menu\\'}]', name='web_search_tool', call_id='call_Vx2pGDGrE8CEZpsgaQO7zUHN', is_error=False)]), TextMessage(id='4b8952d4-3da0-4dbb-a99c-56ec269d52be', source='research_analyst', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=43611, completion_tokens=942), metadata={}, created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 10, 10, 1, 0, 5, 611489, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), content=\"## Executive Summary\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is emerging as a transformative force in healthcare, demonstrating significant potential in areas such as diagnostics, patient management, and administrative tasks.
